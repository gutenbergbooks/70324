<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>ACROSS THE DUB</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> felt very old.</p>

<p>Older than the old face at the table before him,
than the office furniture, which had been there before
he was born, than his father’s portrait over the desk;
older even than the tulip-tree bowing its graceful
head to his window. Very old.</p>

<p>They said the tulip-tree blossomed no more than
once in a hundred years. It was an ancient tree,
biding its time as ancient things may. But Lancaster
felt older even than that.</p>

<p>It had been a trying day. Helwise had made it
trying, to begin with. She had come down to breakfast
in a black print flickering with white spots, and
a whirlpool frame of mind, grievance after grievance
spinning musically to the surface, only to be submerged
again in the twinkling of an eye. In the
intervals of digesting a troublesome correspondence,
he found himself flinging life-belts of common sense
after long-sunk bits of wreckage, gaining nothing but
an impulse of helpless annoyance and a growing dislike
for the flickering spots. Helwise was his aunt
and housekeeper, and though she could add nearly
a score of years to his thirty-seven, the weight of time
lay infinitely lighter upon her shoulders than on his;
perhaps because she twitched them so gracefully from
under every descending yoke. Her delicate face and
softly greying hair gave the impression of a serene
mind and a fading constitution, and if you were not,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
vulgarly speaking, up to snuff, you ran and did things
for Helwise that Helwise ought to have been doing
for you, and she always let you. But the serenity
was sheer illusion and the constitution was tough.
Closer inspection found her racing through life with
the objectless hurry of a cinema express. She shimmered
along a permanent way of mazy speech, and
when you lived close to her you were always breathless
and hurried, and the air was never quiet. She
had the aimless velocity of a trundled hoop, and
accomplished about as much.</p>

<p>Various printed notices drifted across the table on
the rippling and bubbling of worries. She had a
passionate habit of joining societies in all capacities,
from President or Secretary to General Bottle-Washer,
of getting herself appointed on innumerable county
committees. As Lancaster’s aunt she was considered
“the right person,” and as Lancaster’s aunt she took
it for granted that his fingers should straighten the
tangle of her ensuing bewilderment, and make her
trundling path smooth.</p>

<p>He glanced through the circulars quickly, folding
them neatly and adding them to his own collection.
He was very business-like in his movements. The
sheep and the goats of his correspondence were separated
right and left; each envelope had its pencilled
name and date; while the more important took cover
in an elastic band and an inner pocket. His brown
hands were methodical and deft; his weighing eyes
implied a steady brain; his glance at the clock showed
a sense of routine always alert. He was haste without
hurry, while she, like the picture-train, rushed wildly
and got nowhere.</p>

<p>A business-man born and made, you would have
said of Lancelot Lancaster, not of stocks and shares
or rustling parchments, but an acute, sound man of
the land, a lean, light, open-air man, often in the
saddle, with no aim beyond a clear-sighted judgment
of terms and tenants, nor any desire more whimsical
than a steady prosperity. It was only when you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
looked at his mouth, with its hint of patience and
repression, of longing held in leash and idealism
shrouded like a sin, that you wondered if he was not,
after all, only very well-trained.</p>

<p>Yes, Helwise had been particularly trying at breakfast.
Her post had required a lot of explanation,
and his own had included a letter from Bluecaster,
one of the kindly, idiotic letters at which Lanty
smiled and swore in a breath. There was also a
second letter (which of course he had read first) totally
contradicting the other; and at the bottom of all had
been one from the London solicitor, telling him (unofficially)
to take no notice of either. Bluecaster’s
agent pencilled patient comments on the three unnecessary
epistles.</p>

<p>He had spent the morning with a prospective tenant
who had seemed to take a gloating delight in raising
difficulties which would never have so much as
occurred to anybody else; the type of sportsman
who goes house-hunting for the sheer joy of pointing
out to the lessor the contemptible disabilities of his
property. Getting back for lunch at the usual time,
he found that Helwise had had it early and eaten
most of it, afterwards cinematographing off to some
meeting at least an hour too soon; and the afternoon
had seen him harried from pillar to post by an inspector
who kept telephoning trysting-places and never turning
up. Helwise was having tea at her meeting, so there
was none for him unless he chose to order it, and just
as his hand was on the bell, tenants of standing had
arrived, wanting him. It was really the tenants who
had made him feel old.</p>

<p>Facing him at the office-table, Wolf Whinnerah had
the light full upon his fierce old face, with its sunk,
dark eyes and thatch of silver hair. He was over
seventy, but until recently he had carried his years
with an almost miraculous lightness. Now, at last,
however, the rigorous hand of Time had touched him
suddenly, breaking him in a few weeks. Pneumonia,
during a trying season, had carried him very near the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
grave, and though he had fought his way back, he
was nevertheless a beaten man. The strong bones of
his keen face showed their clean lines under his furrowed
skin. His height was dwindled, his step grown uncertain,
his grasp weakened, his sight dulled. The end
of the things that mattered had come to old Wolf
Whinnerah.</p>

<p>His son—his only child—sat between the other two
men, with his back to the fireplace. He had the
mountain colouring, for all that he had been bred on
a marsh-farm—the dark hair, and the gray eyes that
have the blue of mountain-mist across them, the dale
length and breadth, too, and the long, easy, almost
lurching swing in his walk. And he had the slow,
soft, deep, dale voice, and its gentle, distant dignity
of manner.</p>

<p>He sat, for the most part, looking at the table, while
his father laid his case before the agent. It was a
case that put himself hopelessly in the wrong, but he
kept his mouth shut, and stayed undefended. He
had learned to keep his mouth shut. Argument with
Wolf generally led to something perilously near unharnessed
battle. He was over thirty, now, and
during all the years he had worked for his father he
had never had a penny’s wage. He had been kept
and clothed, like a child, had tips for treats doled him
like a child, and like a child been ruled in all his ways.
He did not resent it; there was no question of injustice,
since it was the custom in his class, and only
slowly was it drawing towards change. But it kept
a man his father’s property in a way curiously patriarchal
and out of date to an outsider, making paternal
authority a mighty weapon, and filial independence a
strange, iconoclastic crime.</p>

<p>“Yon’s the way of it, sir!” old Whinnerah finished,
leaning back in his chair, and spreading the long
fingers of his knotted hand along the table, opening
and shutting them slowly, as if they levered the
operation of his mind. “I’m done, and the farm
must go; and if the lad won’t take it on, as he says<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
he won’t, why, then, there’s nowt for it but I must
go an’ all!”</p>

<p>He looked down at his hand as he spoke, and clenched
it, for it was trembling. The other men looked at it,
too, Lancaster with regretful eyes; but the younger
glanced away sharply, and set the line of his mouth
a trifle closer.</p>

<p>“It’s bad hearing!” the agent said at last, seeing
that the son did not mean to speak. “You’ve been
at Ninekyrkes so long, you Whinnerahs. Naturally
we like to keep the farms in the family, if it’s a family
worth having. We’d be more than sorry to part
with you—you don’t need telling that. Can’t you
see your way to stopping on a bit longer yourself?”</p>

<p>The old man raised himself painfully to his feet,
looking indeed like a grim old wolf, with the last yard
of pace run out of him, and the last ounce of fight
gone from him. His name he owed to a family tradition
tracing a connection with Hugh Lupus of the Conquest,
through his sister Lucia. Wolf’s son had the name in
its Latin dignity, long since distorted to everyday
use.</p>

<p>“I said I was done, Mr. Lancaster! You’ve eyes
in your head as’ll show you, right enough. Yon time
I was down such a terrible while, a year come Martinmas,
that finished me, or I’d have likely been good for
another nice few years. But I can’t carry the whole
farm, now. I must give it over to a younger pair o’
hands. Not that I’m grudging that; it comes to all
of us, in the end; but I’m rare an’ sore they’ll not be
Whinnerah hands, Mr. Lancaster! The lad’s set on
going abroad, as I’ve told you. He says he’ll not
bide. I could have done a bit on the farm along with
him, even yet—odd jobs to earn my board and keep
my old bones warmed, but wanting him I’ll have to
quit for good, and see other folk of another breed in
the old spot. It’s not what I looked for, sir, not what
I meant, and I’ll take it hard. I’ll take it hard!”</p>

<p>He lowered himself shakily back to his chair, and
his hand slid out again on the table, opening and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
shutting, opening and shutting. Lup did not move,
nor did his mouth alter. There came a second silence.</p>

<p>“Well, you know your own business best, of course,”
Lancaster said presently, wondering what lay behind;
“but surely”—he turned to the young man—“surely
you don’t really mean leaving us? There has never
been any misunderstanding either on your side or
ours that I know of. My father thought a lot of you
all—that’s old news, isn’t it?—and I’m of his mind.
What’s making you quit, Lup, just when you’re needed
most?”</p>

<p>Lup looked at the table and his father’s hand.</p>

<p>“I can’t stop, sir,” he said, respectfully but quite
definitely. “I’m sorry if it’s putting folk about, but
I reckon I’ll be better suited on the other side o’ the
dub.”</p>

<p>“Canada?” The agent smiled and frowned.
“Come, Lup, we can’t part with you, and that’s
the long and the short of it! They’re taking too
many of our best men, as it is. I don’t want to
preach, but doesn’t it seem to you that it’s your
duty to stay with your father as long as he wants
you?”</p>

<p>“Happen it be,” laconically.</p>

<p>“Then, for every sake, man, stop!”</p>

<p>“Nay, I’ll not.”</p>

<p>He shut his mouth again, and Lancaster looked
across to the father with a half shrug, then slewed on
another tack.</p>

<p>“It’s a good farm, and you’ve done well by it.
There’s money behind you, and money before you,
which is more than a deal of folk can say. You’ll
find nothing like Ninekyrkes, over there. Hasn’t it
any memories for you? I don’t mind laying you’ll
find it tug pretty hard on the other side!” He
paused, and tried again. It was a very one-sided
conversation. “I understood you were thinking of
getting married—that there was to be a wedding on
the far marsh. Do you propose taking the lady with
you ‘across the dub?’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>The blood flamed over the set obstinacy of the dark
face, but died instantly.</p>

<p>“I’ll not bide!” he said again, and that was all.</p>

<p>A wave of hysterical revolt broke over the dispossessed
at his side. Wolf’s self-command was never
of a lasting quality, and it had been very sorely tried.</p>

<p>“Nay, but I’ll not have you gang!” he cried,
shaking from head to foot with the terrible effort of
finished age forcing its will upon dogged youth and
strength. “You’ll stop till I’m in my grave and
through an’ by with my job for good! You’ll be quit
of me <i>then</i>, right enough, and free to set about any
daft-like scheme you choose, but I’m not under the
sod yet, and I’ll see you do as you’re bid. I was a
fool ever to hark to you! I should have said nay
and nay to it from the start. It’s not so long since
I could have broken my stick across you, an’ I’m not
feared of you, now. Am I like to be feared, d’you
think”—a sneer edged his quivering voice—“of a
fool as can’t stick out a bit of a disappointment, as
gets sneck-posset from the lass he’s after, and bides
door slapped in his face without so much as shoving
a foot inside? Nay, I’ll tell you what it is, my lad!
she cares nowt, I tell you—nowt——!”</p>

<p>He stopped, for Lup had risen to his feet and bent
towards him, so that over the table the two dark
faces almost met, and before the steady anger of
his eyes and locked lips even old Wolf was stilled.
Lancaster felt the swift current of hatred and bitterness
flash between them, sensed the passionate resentment,
puzzle, and pain. Then Lup turned on his heel
and went out.</p>

<p>“I’ll be yoking up, sir,” he threw over his shoulder
as he disappeared, and presently they heard his long,
unhurrying tread across the cobbled yard.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble, Wolf?” Lancaster asked
gently, as the clatter of hoofs and the jingle of harness
came in through the open window. “What’s put the
lad wrong?”</p>

<p>“Nowt but what puts every lad wrong, soon or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
late!” the other answered bitterly, sinking back.
“It’s Dockeray’s lass, her as went to boarding school
for a sight o’ years, and come back with a look an’ a
way with her fit to beat a ladyship! Lup was always
set on her, ay, an’ she on him, if seeing’s believing.
They’ve been courtin’ this year past and more, going
to singin’-practice an’ pill-gills an’ such-like, and I’ve
never known her give him a wrong word. And then,
when it comes to taking on the farm and getting wed
and settling down, she’ll have none of it! She was at
our spot to supper, the night it first come up. Whinnerahs
and Dockeray’s have always been rarely thick,
you’ll think on, living alongside, just them two selves
right away over yon. You could never put a pin
between ’em. Well, as I told you, she was having a
bit o’ supper with us when I first spoke. I’d had it
in my mind for long, ever since I was badly, but I’d
put it by, time an’ again, and let it be. Likely I was
no more ready than most to be set on the shelf, but
the lad’s getting on, an’ he’d a right to his chance.
I’d had a hard day, too, and it came over me sudden-like
as I was done for good, and in a queer sort o’ way
I was glad to be through with it all and rest, if it
didn’t mean quitting. I thought of the old chair in
the corner, and the view of a summer evening, and the
sea washing at the wall, an’—an’ all the other things
meaning Ninekyrkes and no other spot whatever!
I’m not saying any man cares to sit by and see his
son master where he’s held the reins, but there was a
sort of pleasure in feeling I’d done with my job. I
reckon the Almighty sends you that as a kind o’ sop,
just to keep you from fretting over hard. And so I
just up an’ told them how it was. I said I’d see you,
sir, about handing the farm over, and then I says to
Lup, ‘Now, Lup, my lad,’ says I, ‘You’ve been courtin’
long enough an’ to spare, and it’s time you settled
down. We’ll change jobs this Martinmas, an’ you
can get wed, an’, please God, there’ll be Whinnerahs at
Ninekyrkes for many a long year to come. It’s a
bargain, lad, that’s what it is! So now, Miss Francey,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
don’t you keep him waiting. You be getting your
gear an’ such-like together, and we’ll have the wedding
as soon as ever you can make shape to be ready!’
Yon’s what I said, an’ I reckon I put it real smart, eh,
Mr. Lancaster?”—the agent nodded response to the
appeal for commendation—“but happen it was over-smart-like
for Dockeray’s lass! She never so much as
coloured up or turned shy, but she round with her
head very slow an’ looked at me that calm—she’s got
quality’s ways with her, sir, as I said, very soft an’
kind, but with something holding her off at the back—an’
says she, in her whyet voice, ‘And what’s all that
to do with me, Mr. Whinnerah?’ Eh! but I was
rarely bothered just for the minute! When I come
to think of it, there’d never been owt in black an’
<i>white</i>, after a manner of speaking. Lup’s not one for
tongue-wagging, you’ll have found that for yourself.
For all I could ha’ sworn to there might never have
been talk o’ weddin’ betwixt ’em at all; but they’d
been together a deal, an’—an’—why, I’d seen Lup’s
eyes on her acrost table, an’ I’d be like to know, I
reckon, when a Whinnerah’s set on a lass! So after
a bit o’ coughing and fidging, thinking she was happen
likely just joking us, I got out as we’d always taken it
as she and Lup was sweethearts.</p>

<p>“‘Happen we be!’ says she, only in quality-talk,
and she gives Lup the sweetest little look sideways as
set him shining like the Angel Gabriel!</p>

<p>“‘Why, then, what there’s nowt to find!’ says I,
trying not to get above myself. ‘If you’re courtin’,
you’re likely thinking to get wed, and now’s your
time. What’s to hinder? The farm’s ready, and the
lad.’</p>

<p>“‘Ay, but not the lass!’ says she, spirity-like.
‘The right time’s my own time, and I’ll come when I
choose!’</p>

<p>“‘You’ll come when Lup chooses!’ I said, fair
lossing my temper out an’ out. ‘Tell her that, my lad.
Tell her she’ll come when she’s fetched!’</p>

<p>“But Lup just sat there like a half-rocked ’un,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
glowering at nowt an’ saying less, as he did just now,
and then my lady gets on her feet and has her talk
out.</p>

<p>“‘You mean kindly,’ she says, ‘and to be fair and
just, but you don’t understand how it looks to me.
It’s the way things are worked, I know. A lad slaves
for his father for years after he’s a man grown, with
never so much as a penny to put between his teeth,
and at last, when the old man’s tired, he gives his son
his chance. Round comes the agent, and it’s, “You’re
for getting wed, I reckon? Right!” (if it <i>is</i> right),
and the contract’s made. The lass goes into the
contract along with the farm, and along at the beck of
the three men to the church. Well, that’s your way,
but it’s not mine, and you may as well know it first
as last. I’ll come when I’m ready, or I’ll never come
at all!’</p>

<p>“And with that she took herself off, an’ after a
minute Lup up an’ followed her. He didn’t come
home while morning—I’ve an idea he spent the night
on the sea-wall—and after that it was Canada. Ay,
an’ Canada it’ll be, sir, and no two words about it!”</p>

<p>He stopped, exhausted, and Lancaster laughed.</p>

<p>“Why, man, you’re worrying yourself for nothing!
It’s a lovers’ quarrel—no more. I thought, by the
look of you, there was murder in the wind! Come,
there’s no sense in whistling up your own ill-luck.
The girl will be round again at the swing of the pendulum
by this time to-morrow. She’ll pull up to the
pole all right, you take my word!”</p>

<p>The old man shook a dogged contradiction.</p>

<p>“You’ve seen Lup,” he said. “You know how far
there’s bending <i>him</i>. Have you seen the lass, sir?
Nay? What, then——” on a sudden, cheering impulse—“see
here, sir, suppose <i>you</i> put in a word?”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” Lancaster laughed again, amused
but embarrassed. “You want me to tackle her—talk
to her nicely, point out what she’s throwing away?
That’s a bit too much to ask, Wolf! I’m not agent
for Bluecaster for that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>“She’d happen take it from you. She’d ha’ took
it from your father, Mr. Lancaster. There’s a many
he’s talked into a right way o’ thinking—ay, an’
women-folk among ’em!—as is glad and proud of it
to-day.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I’m——” Lancaster looked rather helpless—“well—not
my father, Wolf!”</p>

<p>“You’re your father’s son. What a Lancaster says,
goes—with most of us. You’ll try it, sir?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how I can. What has your wife to say
about it?”</p>

<p>“Something of the same mak as Lup, sir—lile or
nowt, an’ nowt most often of the two. She sticks to
it there’s trouble ahead, anyhow, and it’s no odds
what road it travels. She’s got a queer trick of sitting
an’ watching the tide, like as if she’s waiting to see
something happen.”</p>

<p>“But surely she’s tried to make Lup hear reason?”</p>

<p>“Ay, I reckon she has, though she’s never let wit
on it to me. He’s the very apple of her eye; she’s
not like to let him go unspoken. But you’ll have a
shot, won’t you, Mr. Lancaster? Do, sir—do now!”
The tone was first wheedling, then wistful. “’Tisn’t
only the lad. It means the farm—to me.”</p>

<p>He looked across at the agent with a childlike
trustfulness that was almost absurdly pathetic, and
Lancaster broke suddenly.</p>

<p>“Well, well, I’ll see what I can do!” he said,
smiling somewhat wryly, and went out to help the old
man into his trap, a growing feeling upon him of
having seen the curtain rise upon some slow working
of Fate. The dog-cart jogged through the gate, and
for a moment he saw Lup’s head above the wall as
he turned his horse towards the marsh. The rap of
the hoofs came to him for long enough, dying and
returning, until the last hill between swallowed them
up.</p>

<p>And he felt old.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>THE GREEN GATES OF VISION:—I. DUSK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> went back into the house when the distance had
snapped the last vibrating link, but he did not stay
there. The office was still under the domination of
the young man’s silent anger, the old man’s piteous
revolt. He felt troubled for both, seeing the situation
as each saw it, and was conscious of sharp impatience
with the cause of the deadlock, though in his own
mind he was certain that her obstinacy would not
last. But the whole affair was an unnecessary worry
with which he could have dispensed very thankfully,
and added heavily to his sense of weary irritation.</p>

<p>He found both drawing-room and dining-room
equally unbearable in his present mood, for both were
oppressively characteristic of Helwise, curiously so,
since her character seemed always a shifting thing,
sliding through your fingers and resting nowhere.
He had lost his mother early—before his teens—but
the house, under the firm conservatism of his father
and an old servant, had kept her memory and her
tenets for long. Helwise, however, had banished
them very completely. With a long-nursed resentment
he marked the disorder of the dining-room, the
drunken regiment of chairs, the holes in the lace
curtains, the cheap almanacs pinned haphazard between
the good prints. Helwise loved to surround
herself with calendars. They gave her a sense of keeping
even with Time. He could not steal a march on
her by a single day, while some grocer’s tribute marked
the black footsteps of his pilgrimage. Yet she rarely
availed herself of their services, left them hanging for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
years—horrible traps to the unwary—her own hasty
references being invariably directed to the wrong
month.</p>

<p>Lanty frowned distastefully at their almost ribald
askewness, at the torn places in the paper where the
crooked pins had slipped, at the untidy hearth and wild
mass of correspondence on the open desk. It should
have been a handsome room, by rights, for it was
bright and well proportioned. The severe furniture
that his father had bought had mellowed with time,
and the few bits of silver on the sideboard had lost
their parvenu air of recent presentation. He had
chosen the carpet himself, and its soft, dark tints still
pleased him, in spite of the tread worn white by the
hurrying feet of his aunt. But there was no ease
or homeliness in the room, and it was certainly not
handsome, save as an elderly <i lang="fr">roué</i> of once better days
is handsome, in a last drunken effort after dignity
and repose.</p>

<p>The drawing-room was worse. He had had no
hand in the drawing-room, so Helwise had let herself
loose upon it, with results that made him creep. He
hated it, from the collection of smug pot dogs on the
mantelpiece to the bad Marcus Stone imitations on
the cold blue of the walls. He hated the cheap books
lying about, the spindly furniture, the innumerable
chair-backs bristling so fiercely with pins that you
dared neither lay your head on them in front nor your
hand on them from behind. There was only one comfortable
chair in the room, and that was sacred to
Helwise. Not that she ever actually claimed it as
hers, but if you sat down on it by accident, she wandered
helplessly over the wild-patterned carpet as if there
wasn’t another seat within reach, until you became
gradually aware of criminal poaching, and arose with
shame. There were almanacs here, too, gaudy things
evidently of a higher grade, matching, with a pleasantly
thoughtful touch, the shrieking tiles of the modern
grate. The wide fireplace of his youth had been a
sacred altar, lighting a torch to many dreams, lifting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
the smoke of many prayers; but nobody but a Post-Impressionist
could have prayed to this grate, and its
brazen canopy had never housed a single vision.</p>

<p>With a half-sigh he wandered out again and into
the garden, but even here Helwise had successfully
impressed herself. During one of his very rare absences
she had had the fine box-borders removed, and the
paths edged with glittering rockery-stones, intersected
by scrubby and unwilling little ferns. Lanty never
quite forgot what he had felt at sight of them. There
was an old song he had been used to growl softly as he
walked between the box, a tender thing called “My
Lady’s Garden,” and sometimes, at dusk, after a hard
day, he had vaguely thought to find her there in the
cool of the evening, even as himself and Another. He
had always missed her, but she had been there, he
was sure of that. But when the rockery-stones appeared,
she came no more; and to all his big wants and
losses there was added the loss of a little dream.</p>

<p>That was hard to forgive Helwise, just as it was hard
to forgive her the scars on his precious lawn, where her
heavy niblick had taken greedy mouthfuls, and the
insane bumble-puppy pole, rearing its unsightly length
in the middle of the soft, green stretch. She had a
summer-house, too, a Reckitt’s Blue wooden thing
on wheels, with texts all over it, like a Church Army
Van. All the texts were about food, strung together
at random: “I washed my steps with butter.” “Is
there any taste in the white of an egg?” “There is
nothing better for a man than that he should eat and
drink ... For who can eat, or who else can hasten
hereunto, more than I?” etc., etc. Lanty passed
them with averted eyes, for they reminded him that
he had had no tea and only the scrapings of his aunt’s
lunch, and stopped for comfort before the one spot
in the garden left untroubled, a stone seat in the
terrace wall, with straggling letters running along its
curve. “The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet,”
said the quiet seat in the wall, a soothing rede for a tired
heart, no matter how the truth might rage and storm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
without. With its balm upon his lips he dropped
into the road through a little stile, and came before
long, without pause or thought, to a lane winding
across country vaguely south. He looked about him
before turning into it. If there had been anybody in
sight, he would have taken another way, but there
was not a soul even far distant, and he stepped in
quickly.</p>

<p>Once within its bounds, however, he slackened his
pace to an almost hushed saunter. You did not use
this lane as a muscular training-ground or a mere short
cut; you crept into it on tiptoe, and caught it unawares.
It was a capricious lane, racing up and down
tiny hills between its high, warm, leaning hedges,
spinning round sharp corners out of sight, or running
innocently to alluring gateways, only to leave you
stranded on arrival. It was full of surprises, full of
secrets. As you walked, you heard all sorts of bewitching
sounds above and around you, sounds you
had known always and sounds you never heard anywhere
else. You knew, for instance, the slur of the
plough, the whistle of the blackbird, the whirr of the
grass-cutter, the slash of the bill-hook on a far fence,
the gnawing of turnips, the wind-talk of dead leaves.
But there were others you never placed: elf-like
twitterings that never came from any bird’s throat,
weird, hoarse grunts like some guttural gnome-language
that couldn’t possibly be just a sheep coughing; and
if you caught the right time on the right night, you
would hear a rustling along the lower fields as the
Brush-Harrow Dobbie went by, with never a horse
before it nor a man behind. There was also the
famous Bluecaster Black-Dog Dobbie, which slunk
stealthily at your side, panting and padding ever so
softly in the dusk, and disappearing into the wraith
of an old Tithe-Barn long since fallen away, that had
once marked the boundary of the estate.</p>

<p>Besides these attractions, Lanty had a ghost of his
own, and half his joy in the lane lay in wondering if
he should find it. It was a very deep lane. You had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
to look up and up before you saw the feathery tops
kissing the sky, and you walked between, very warm
and safe and quiet, listening with all your ears at once.
And then, all of a sudden, there would be a break on
the lower side, and over a couple of moss-grown bars,
or an ancient gate thrust in at any and every beautiful
angle, you would see the lovely land sweeping down and
out beneath you, and rising slowly, slowly again to
soft curves and blue vapours. They came all along
the lane, these flashing little peeps of a world shut
out, like cloister vignettes in some silent Abbey.
Your heart went before you hungrily to each, yet was
loth to leave any for the next. And which was more
dear, the tender quiet or the land through its living
frame, it would have been hard to say. Lancaster
called the peeps his Green Gates of Vision.</p>

<p>He stopped at the first of all, and his Ghost was
there to meet him, a long, faint, knife-edged mountain,
flung like a cloud against the south-west sky. It was
often missing, and at its clearest the mass of it was no
more than a blown web, yet the line of it had always
the quivering sharpness of steel. He had grown to
believe that the sight of it brought him luck, this
Ghost-Mountain of his, so christened because it never
seemed but the ghost of a hill, edged with the spirit-fire
of something safe escaped from clogging matter.
Its absence did not depress him, but its presence,
sprung suddenly upon his cloistered walk, always
made his heart leap, as at an unexpected promise of
goodwill. He welcomed it to-day when he was weary
and out of tune, and he leaned his arms on the weathered
timber with a sense of rest, drawing his gaze slowly
back from the far symbol to the country close at
hand.</p>

<p>Four or five dropping fields away, Rakestraw stood
in its sheath of woods, the new hay thick in the grey
Dutch barns. There were rooks’ nests in the trees
overhanging the house; even at that distance he could
see them. That meant luck for Rakestraw, said the
wise. He had always told himself that he would live<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
at Rakestraw when the cease-fire sounded for the work
he loved, farm it himself, lead his hay and breed his
stock, and perhaps the rooks would build for him, too,
as they had built for Dart Newby. He knew in his
heart that he would never do it, just because it seemed
so essentially the beautiful and right thing for him to
do. Most of us have our dream-houses somewhere,
and plot and plan their future and ours together;
and whether we ever win to them or not with a signed
conveyance, we have something of them always that
is never set down in any legal bond.</p>

<p>To the left he could see the road twisting and dipping
but yet steadily rising towards Gilmichel, and another
road far away on higher land, with Topthorns set on
its edge; then Dick Crag, like a soft, gray bear raising
itself on hind legs to look abroad, and, behind it, fold
on fold of neutral-tinted, blended fells. On the right
the land rose again, only more sharply, until the line
of the hedges broke once more into the sky, but over
the hill he knew was Gilthrotin in the hollow, with its
one little, steep street, its old bridge and ancient
church, and its empty, eyeless manor-house topping
the terrace over the river. He would come to that
presently, when, by slow and delicious chapters, he
had read his lane from start to finish.</p>

<p>Leaning there, his eyes resting on restful Rakestraw,
he went back in mind to his late interview and the
task he had undertaken. It was only one among
many unconventional duties falling to him, he reflected,
with the same wry smile. As agent for the
Bluecaster estate, free to use his own discretion in
almost every instance, yet often tied hand and foot
by old observance, he frequently found himself in
situations for the right conduct of which there could
be no possible arbiter but his own judgment. Old
duties were his along with the outside management,
duties of house-steward and administrator, and even
where his rule ended, the claims on him went on. If
a casual visitor at the “Feathers” was lost out fishing,
Lancaster was called to find him, as a matter of course.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
If the draper wished to commit suicide, Lancaster was
fetched to command him to desist. If the doctor
objected to the rates, or the parson struck a bad rock
in Local Government, Lancaster was signalled for aid.
Difficulties of all sorts came to him for settlement,
from disputes over neighbours’ hens and washing and
fondness for the American organ, to the moot point
whether your money ought or ought not to go to your
wife’s relations.</p>

<p>At the age of twenty-four, when scarcely through his
training, he had been thrust into his father’s place by
a blast of sudden death which carried off master, heir,
and steward in the same month. The new lord was
only just of age, and glad enough to have a Lancaster
to lean on, so that before the young agent had learned
to stand alone, he had the whole estate upon his
shoulders. Thirteen years it was now since he took
hold. Thirteen years since Jeffrey Kennet Cospatrick,
tenth Baron Bluecaster, greeted his inheritance with a
sigh. He was a kindly, shy young man, one of those
puzzling natures that swing from an almost idiotic
simple-mindedness to sudden touches of shrewdness;
that take everybody at face-value three-fourths of the
time, and for the rest can see through a stone wall. He
had few near relations, and for the most part spent his
flying visits to Bluecaster alone, but he always came
when he was wanted, ready to face some traditional
ordeal with a shy effort. He was generous, too—to
a fault—but even in his most ultra-altruistic flights he
could be made to listen to reason. Indeed, his faith
in his agent was almost irritatingly sublime; there
were times when the latter longed earnestly for a man
who could see things steadfastly through his own
eyes, Bluecaster leaned so heavily. Yet he knew
himself wonderfully fortunate, and it was only when
he was very wearied or worried, as he had been of
late, that he felt his shoulders ache.</p>

<p>It was scarcely strange that he should feel old; he
had had so little time to be really young. There were
drawbacks to being the son of a fine man, he thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
occasionally. People expected you to start where your
father left off, to keep up his standard of ripe experience
where any other beginner would be busy learning
from his own mistakes. The tenants had turned to him
from the first with the personal confidence and affection
that they had given his predecessor, scarcely realising
that he had not yet grown to the full stature of control.
He had gone through hard years, often troubling himself
unnecessarily, but in the end he had won out.
Before he was thirty he had come to father the whole
lot of them, Bluecaster included. The trust was his
dearest possession, but, serving it, he had missed his
youth.</p>

<p>His work was the breath of his life; its varied
interests kept him keen and stimulated, but they
increased continually, and every year new legislation
made things more difficult for those engaged with land.
The county, too, had claimed him, and he had yielded,
inch by inch, to the fascination making almost the
sole reward of the Great Unpaid. He had not had
a holiday for years; he was too absorbed, too pressed,
too afraid of getting behind. Besides, no other place
called him. The whole of his heart was here.</p>

<p>Things might have run easier if Helwise had been—well,
something quite inconceivably different from
what she was. Her descent upon his desolate hearth
from unrewarding efforts as companion to successive
old ladies, had been welcomed by him at the time,
not knowing that it was her special mission in life to
make it more desolate still. He had been too busy at
first to notice the atmosphere with which she surrounded
him, attributing his dreariness of spirit to
his father’s loss and his over-heavy task; and by the
time he had made himself and formed his routine, it
was too late to send her away. She was happy after
her own parasitical fashion, and to uproot her now
would mean a gigantic effort to which neither his will
nor his heart felt equal. But of late there had grown
upon him a longing for a home of his own making, an
atmosphere with which Helwise should never have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
anything to do. He murmured old Samuel Daniel’s
words as he leaned against the gate.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“To have some silly home I do desire,</div>
<div class="verse">Loth still to warm me by another’s fire.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>He had a home, certainly, and one silly enough, too,
in its mismanagement and lack of all peace; but it
was another silliness for which he yearned, the silliness
of little, common home-interests and home-jokes, of
crossed glances and talk without words, of parting
kisses and meeting hands. He had a fire, of course,
as well; that is to say, he paid for it; but in every
other sense it was “another’s.” He thought of the
drawing-room grate and renounced it violently.</p>

<p>Dusk was drawing down, now, though the Mountain
still stayed with him, faintly limned as a dried tear.
Milking was over at Rakestraw. He watched the cattle
coming out from the shippons to a quiet night in the
cool fields. Near at hand a sleepy twittering told
him where a late-nested bird was hidden close. The
clipped sheep and the sturdy lambs still called to each
other, as if the tender time of mother-love was not yet
over; and far down on the road he could hear children
pattering home from their summer treat. There came
into his head a song he had heard at a musical festival.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“What can lambkins do,</div>
<div class="verse">All the keen night through?</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“What can nestlings do</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>Well, his hour of comfort and sanctity was nearly
over. His soothed nerves gave him courage to laugh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
at his own longings. He must get back to Helwise
and other duties, think out some plan of campaign
with regard to Dockeray’s recalcitrant daughter. He
raised himself reluctantly, wondering, at the last
moment, what encouragement his Ghost was about
to send him, when he was brought round sharply by
sounds of frivolous song pouring down the lane.
The shuttered quiet passed. The sheep, newly snuggled
under the hedge, scattered in bleating alarm; fresh
twitterings broke from the late nest, and every shy-peeping
fairy-thing became instantly dumb and dead.</p>

<p>With the song came a shuffling as of dancing, and
panting requests to the singer to “bang a bit more
on the brass!” and as Lancaster, standing in the rutted
road, looked up to the first frolicking bend, two figures
whirled into sight through the thin veil of eve. Behind,
their obedient accompanist let out his fine voice
a little further. With the singer was a girl.</p>

<p>The dancers, closely clasped in each other’s arms,
executed a series of intricate steps from hedge to hedge
with the unanimity and gravity of extremely superior
marionettes. They wore dinner-coats and evening
pumps; their heads were bare, and now and then
Lancaster caught the gleam of shirt-fronts as he
watched them swing down through the dusk. He did
not know them, he felt certain of that, and wondered
in widening circles until he remembered that the eyeless
house over the hill had been sold recently, and that
these must be some of its new occupants. Watters
was Gilthrotin property, and therefore not in his
hands, and though he had been present at the sale, he
had forgotten the buyer, though he had marked the
Lancashire name as one with plenty of money behind
it. That accounted for the strangers. It did not
account though, he thought, ruffled and jarred, for
their bad taste in thrusting noisily into his lane just
at fairy-time. With the dogged resentment of the
conscientious objector who stands stolidly in front of
a motor-car, he remained in the middle of the road
until the dancers ran into him. They spun in opposite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
directions, clutching at nothing, and the singer broke
on a high note. Lancaster went on standing still.</p>

<p>The girl stepped forward, her whitely gray gown showing
moth-like in the shadows. The disgruntled performers
were busy picking themselves out of the
hedge, breathing somewhat offhand apology.</p>

<p>“I hope they didn’t hurt you?” she began
anxiously. “It’s the Tango. They don’t seem able
to stop doing it, and of course they are only boys and
very foolish. I do hope you’re not hurt!”</p>

<p>Lancaster assured her, smiling a little grimly, that
he was perfectly whole. If anybody was hurt, it was
much more likely to be the Tangoists in the hedge.
These now came up, still panting.</p>

<p>“Licks creation! Stuns the stars! Bangs Banagher!
I say, beastly sorry we barged into you like
that. Took you for a turnip, honest injun we did!
We’re shooting over to Bluecaster after a smoke-shop,
and we thought it just as easy to tango there. And
I say, look here! You’ll know what time they close,
I expect. I suppose we can do it all right?”</p>

<p>“It’s six furlongs, and you’ve just ten minutes,”
Lancaster answered severely. “You may do it, with
luck. But if you beat Banagher down the hill in that
costume, you’ll probably find yourself in jail in less
time still.”</p>

<p>“Right-o, old cock! What’s a furlong, anyway?
Anybody seen a furlong? As to the togs, why, it’s
the country, the dear, silly old simple-life country!
You can do anything you like in the country, or else
what’s the good of it? Come on, you fellows, we’ve
got to get that smoke!”</p>

<p>They flew together again in a furious embrace, and
spun away out of sight, whistling like flying engines
at a crossing. The girl and the singer stayed behind,
still apologetic.</p>

<p>“You’d have gone quicker by the main road,”
Lancaster said stiffly, still resentful. “But of course
you probably know that already.”</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>“Yes. But the boys wanted to come by the lane.
They love the lane. When they don’t tango, they
bring the car and squeeze her along as fast as they
can. The hedges are too high, though; you daren’t
risk the turns. If they were only clipped so that
you could see over, it would make a fine test for
steering!”</p>

<p>The singer in the background began an appeasing
little chant, as if he knew that Lancaster writhed.</p>

<p>“Perhaps some of us prefer it as it is,” he answered
coldly. “Hadn’t you better be looking after your—your
brothers? There’s rather a smart police-sergeant
in Bluecaster.”</p>

<p>“They’re not my brothers. They’re just stopping
with us, that’s all. Are we trespassing?” She lifted
an anxious face. “I didn’t know the lane was yours.
I’m ever so sorry! We’d better go on, hadn’t we,
after the boys? but we’ll come back the other way.”</p>

<p>Lanty reddened, ashamed. The singer gave him a
friendly smile over the girl’s head.</p>

<p>“It isn’t my lane—of course not. There’s no
reason you shouldn’t motor down it if you happen
to know a collapsible method of passing carts. It’s a
favourite walk of mine, that’s all. And everything
was just about asleep.”</p>

<p>She looked a little puzzled and still troubled.</p>

<p>“I expect you <i>do</i> feel it’s your own lane, really!
I’ve only been here since March—we’re at Watters in
Gilthrotin—but I’ve noticed people seem to think that
lots of things belong to them just because they’ve
had them somewhere round all their lives—hills and
footpaths and favourite views—things like that. The
man in the cottage behind us was dreadfully vexed
because we cut down a half-dead sycamore by the
river. He said he was used to seeing it from his bedroom
window—wasn’t it funny of him? That’s what
you feel about the lane, though, isn’t it? I wish I’d
known! Any other lane would have done for us.”</p>

<p>Lancaster choked his feelings with an effort.</p>

<p>“Please do not bother about me,” he said curtly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
raising his cap. “You have every right to the lane.
And I don’t think it was funny at all. Good-night.”</p>

<p>She responded reluctantly, feeling that she had
somehow failed to put things right. She wanted to
placate this cross, solitary-minded person who had
already turned his thin, serious face back to the break
in the hedge. Perhaps he was not really cross. He
might be suffering from nerves. They ought not to
have worried him, poor thing!</p>

<p>A young moon came up over the hill. For a moment
they looked together through the green arch.</p>

<p>“It must be fearfully quiet, down there!” she said,
nodding towards the buildings hugging the land close
as if they loved it and were loved in return. “I’m
not sure I shall like living in the country. Everything
seems to be listening for something that never gets
itself said. And why don’t they put the poor animals
under cover? I should hate to spend the night out
of doors, myself!”</p>

<p>He had been watching the moon and his wraith of
a Mountain, and at her words he winced again. She
was shattering his magic with both hands. She had
no thought for the summer dew or the nestled lambs,
the grey robe of the night or the gentle miracle of
dawn. It meant nothing to her, this creeping mystery
of eve.</p>

<p>“Thought I heard a policeman’s whistle a minute
ago,” he observed casually. “I met the constable
following up tramps when I came out. Perhaps your
folks have run into him.”</p>

<p>With a sense of relief he found himself alone again
at last, but the charm had temporarily vanished, the
fairy-things remained away. He wished she had not
looked through his Green Gate with her alien eyes;
he was afraid of seeing things as she saw them. She
had thought it nicer for the stock to be indoors, just
as she doubtless thought it better for him to be under
his own roof instead of mooning about a ridiculous
lane. He loathed the thought of his own house at
that moment. He disliked the girl who had broken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
the happy spell. He leaned over the gate in the
gloaming, watching the quietened sheep, and trying
to call the magic back.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>TROUBLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> rode over to Ladyford the following afternoon.</p>

<p>Helwise came agitating on to the doorstep, just as
his foot was in the stirrup, to tell him that his lordship
had returned unexpectedly.</p>

<p>“He telephoned from the House in the middle of
the morning,” she went on, with the high-pitched,
running ease which always seemed to make every
difficult situation doubly trying. “He said he would
like to see you at your earliest convenience, but of
course I told him you were engaged both this morning
and afternoon, and to-night you were going to take
me to that lecture on ‘The Home Beautiful.’ (It
<i>was</i> to-night, wasn’t it?) I forgot to tell you at
lunch. I think it just as well, Lancelot, to let his
lordship know how extremely busy you are, and not
always able to run at his beck and call. I am sure
it is quite time you applied for a rise, with all these
horrid insurances to add up. We could do quite easily
with a small brougham.”</p>

<p>Lanty loosed the stirrup.</p>

<p>“I’m quite satisfied with my screw, thank you,”
he answered shortly. “You know Bluecaster’s
generosity as well as I do. And I do wish, Helwise,”
(their old Lancaster names formed the one love they
had in common), “that you wouldn’t arrange my
business for me. I could have gone to Ladyford to-morrow,
and this morning I was no further than the
show-field, having a look round. You might have
sent Armer with a message. He was only helping
you to thread that bead-curtain. I’ll go in and ring
his lordship up at once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>He turned towards the door, but she stopped
him.</p>

<p>“It’s no good; he won’t be at home. He said he
was going out to lunch—I forget where—but he
assured me it would be quite all right if you went up
in the morning. So you see there’s nothing to prevent
you riding over to Ladyford, and as you’re passing
through Sandwath I do wish you would call at Brunskill’s
for my watch. The man in Bluecaster is no
more good than my shoe. And—oh, Lancelot!—I do
believe it’s the Annual Meeting of the Nursing Association
to-day, and it had gone clean out of my mind!
I’m something important, I’m sure—let me see, what
was it?—oh, yes, of course, Honorary Secretary—and
they’ll certainly expect me to be there, but it’s absolutely
out of the question. I’ve promised to drive to
a bazaar in Witham with Harriet Knewstubb—I
believe we’re judging something—I’ve forgotten what—but
I can’t possibly leave her in the lurch. The
report is ready—you went through it for me last week,
if you remember—but I simply can’t be there to
present it. Couldn’t you do it for me?”</p>

<p>“No, I couldn’t!” Lanty returned firmly. “I
do some queer jobs both for you and for Bluecaster,
but I haven’t yet got as far as presenting reports at a
nursing meeting. Throw over Harriet and get along
to your post. If you don’t want to walk, you can
order a trap from the ‘Feathers.’”</p>

<p>“I dare say, but I shan’t try. You know what
Harriet is if you go back on her—her language, I mean.
The whole nursing committee <i>and</i> the patients wouldn’t
be in it. I do think you might help me, Lancelot!
It isn’t often I turn to you for assistance.”</p>

<p>The last phrase had been part of his life so long that
it did not draw even a mental shrug. In a way he
had grown almost to welcome it, since it marked the
full stop to some tangled rigmarole. As a rule, he
awaited it patiently with shut ears, and answered—something.</p>

<p>“I’ll help you by leaving the report as I pass, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
you like,” he said, at last, “but you can’t expect me
to do more. What time is the meeting? Three?
Then I shall only just do it. Fetch the papers along,
please, and don’t invent any fresh messages for his
lordship while I’m away.”</p>

<p>“And while you’re getting them,” he threw after
her, “just think up some really plausible lie. Even a
committee of women won’t swallow that bazaar.”</p>

<p>He stood waiting with a hand on the saddle, too
trained to patience even to flick his worn cords with
a restless whip. Blacker, the horse, had the same air
of long-suffering towards feminine caprice. The black
spaniel sank her nose between her paws. Black was
the Bluecaster colour, from the flag on the roof to the
household liveries and the pigs at the Home Farm.
There had been a Bluecaster, fleeing from the Plague,
who had put all posterity into mourning for his
particular sins.</p>

<p>The odd-job man, who did a little of everything,
including stable-work and summer-house texts, leaned
somnolently against the horse’s shoulder. Lanty exchanged
a word with him, and then left him in peace.
Armer had had a hard morning. Helwise was entered
for a bumble-puppy competition, in aid of a Dogs’
Home, and when he had finished the bead-curtain he
had been called out to give her practice.</p>

<p>Through a window above she could be heard engaged
in a scatter-brained search, and Lanty wondered
vaguely why she kept nursing reports in the bathroom,
but to follow the workings of Miss Lancaster’s
mind was to return Ophelia-like, weaving wreaths for
one’s distracted head. She appeared at last with a
bundle of papers through which he looked carefully,
having once been basely misled over Boarding-Out
Agenda produced by him on her behalf at a golf-meeting;
receiving a volley of instructions as he
climbed finally into the saddle.</p>

<p>“If you don’t like to mention the bazaar, you must
think of something for yourself,” she told him, following
him down the drive. “There are plenty of useful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
things to say on these occasions, and nobody believes
them. And you can just tell them I think nothing
of the new district nurse—nothing at all! I’ve met
her at least three times this week, and she never even
dreams of bowing to me. Of course, I wasn’t able to
attend the meeting at which she was interviewed, but
that’s no excuse, as she must know as well as I do that
I’m the Treas—no, what was it?—Honorary Secretary.
She cycles with her saddle far too low, too—wait a
minute, though; that was the last but one—and she
spends too much of her time making herself pleasant
to people of no importance whatever—the sort who
are never ill and don’t subscribe a penny. Don’t
forget the watch, will you, and the slippers—did I
mention the slippers? Bedroom-blue-quilted-one-and-elevenpence-ha’penny—size
6—Wilson’s—no, I can’t
get them in Bluecaster, you might have known that—and
be sure you say something useful!”</p>

<p>She turned to seize on the factotum, who had
adroitly vanished to finish his nap in the harness-cupboard,
and Lanty succeeded in leaving her behind.
Once safe in the road, however, he checked his horse
a moment for a survey of the house. It was a square,
gray-stone building, comfortable and compact, old
enough to have acquired atmosphere, yet not too old
for convenience. The garden, thanks to Armer, and
in spite of Helwise, was looking well. There were
roses everywhere, creepers and climbers as well as
bushes, and here and there the dark velvet of violas
foiled the pallor of the pinks. At the back of Crabtree
Bluecaster stood in its park, with its shoulder to the
hill, and behind and behind again, as far as he could
see, the fells rose in long ranks until the Whygills
towered above them all.</p>

<p>It was a strange day, very sultry and sunless, and
the hills had an edge to their ominous dark blue. The
stillness had a menace in it, too. Only in the garden,
as he looked at it, where the colours showed vividly,
as always before thunder, there seemed a protected
peace. The house slept and the garden held its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
breath, and, caught in the spell, he could almost have
believed the place a home indeed. Then his aunt’s
voice came running (it seemed) from all directions at
once, her feet scurrying in search of the slumbering
one; and with a sigh he touched up the chafing horse,
and made west to the marsh.</p>

<p>He met the district nurse almost immediately, a
bright little woman of 100 h.p. energy, and found no
difficulty in getting himself recognised; and a mile
further on he turned up a drive, drawing rein before a
porch arched with sweetbriar, where he pulled the bell
without dismounting. Mrs. Yare herself came out to
him, and to her he handed the papers. Through the
near window he had a glimpse of a selection of hats,
framing various degrees of interest and annoyance.
His regrets were received with gracefully concealed
unbelief.</p>

<p>“We were all wondering what had happened!” she
told him. “We always have the meeting here—I’m a
Chief Lady Superintendent or something Mikado-ish
of that kind, you know—so I hardly thought Miss
Lancaster could have forgotten, especially as she calls
the meeting herself! I’m very disappointed she
wasn’t able to come, but no doubt we shall manage
all right. She is well, I hope?” she added courteously.</p>

<p>“She is only—mixed,” Lanty answered curtly,
gathering up his reins. “I’m extremely sorry if you
have been put out. Please accept my assurance that
it shall not happen again. I was told to say something
useful,” he finished grimly, “so perhaps you
will be kind enough to convey a message to the committee?
My aunt, with much regret, resigns her
position on the Association!”</p>

<p>Bluecaster, House and village, lay some three miles
from the narrow bay where it ran in to take the rivers
Bytha, Wythe, and Ulva. Lanty could see the
winding estuaries as he topped Hullet, with Wythebarrow
standing out to the marsh on the north-west,
and the grand barrier of Lake hills behind. Both north
and east lay the marsh-farms, part of the rich property<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
which ran from the sea (for the foreshore rights were
Bluecaster’s) to the Yorkshire and Lancashire borders.
But there were only two farms on the north, below
Wythebarrow and across the strait—Ladyford and
Ninekyrkes, standing alone on the lip of the tide.
He lost them again as he dropped into Sandwath,
where he executed his orders, turning into the marsh-road
towards four o’clock.</p>

<p>The same brooding stillness held the bay in thrall;
the same line of warning edged the hills. The tide
was dead out, and the sands lay desolate under the
heavy sky. Now he had the twin farms again, ahead
and across where the bay narrowed in and stopped,
unnaturally white on the gloom of their background,
and flanked by slender stems of larch and fir. The
marsh-road was deep-dyked on either hand, and here
and there in the watery bottom he caught the sunny
gleam of late goldilocks. On his left was the long sea-wall
known as the Let, guarding the eastern marsh;
on his right the land rose gently until it hid the village.
Here were Moss End and Meadow’s Ing, with Lockholme
beyond, and others; and, still beyond, close to
the brown waste, Pippin Hall, where he left his horse.</p>

<p>He skirted the grassy bank for some ten minutes,
and then struck across the sands to his destination.
Walking thus, a lonely speck on the dreary flat, the
isolation of the dwellings in front came to him sharply,
so that their air of prosperous serenity, of tranquil
sureness, seemed almost dangerously provocative.
Far away and out, where the bay, between two headlands,
ran into open water, a slant of light from the
sullen sky laid a shining strip from point to point which
he knew to be the sea. It was there and it was coming,
quietly, perhaps, and inoffensively, but there would be
many a night when it would come like a beast of prey,
ravening its path between narrow shores, devouring
the waiting desert. And yet the farms were not
afraid.</p>

<p>The sea-wall had been carried in front of them also,
reaching out to the last inch of broken land, and from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
thence merging into the huge, defiant bank which had
once been famous throughout the kingdom. It ran
along the coast for a couple of miles, joining the hill
on which the town of Cunswick climbed, and behind
it the reclaimed land lay safe.</p>

<p>Lancaster’s father had built both walls, the success
of the lesser firing him, years later, to throw the larger
gauntlet over the sands. They had christened the
low wall “Lancaster’s Let,” which means merely a
hindrance, but the big bank they had named “Lancaster’s
Lugg,” from the Scandinavian “lugg,” a forelock,
and “lugga,” which means “to pull by the
hair,” for Lancaster had knotted the manes of the
white sea-horses together, and dragged them out of
their ancient stable.</p>

<p>It was built with a high daring across the one lung
of the limited passage, and at its back the grassy waste
harboured sheep and waited for man’s hand; for
though it had long since been mapped out for building,
only one house had risen as yet on the stolen ground.
Lanty had often looked at his father’s plans, and locked
them away again. Something held him back from
putting them into shape, and, moreover, decreasing
values and increasing Government drains had left the
income tight at times. Yet he meant some day to
materialise his father’s dreams, and had good hopes
of them, for Cunswick was a growing seaside resort,
and would eventually take up the land quickly enough.
Meanwhile the big wall held its own, caring nothing
for the onslaughts of the crouching foe behind that
shining line. Whether the full moon brought the
fierce thrust of a heavy swell, or the west wind, riding
a wracked sky, hurried the shock of racing billows,
the bank held off the one and flung back the other,
steadily throwing the trend of the tide to the further
and higher side of the bay. To-day, with never a
trickle of water at its base, it looked like a mighty
serpent on the uncovered sand, winding its slow and
writhing length lazily to the sea, purposeless, abnormal,
monstrous in the unnatural fight and leashed quiet.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
The sands themselves were dangerous—dangerous to
walk and sail, with their deep, shifting banks, unknown
quicksands and tidal bore. The whole place had the
terrible fascination of lurking ill, and yet on all hands
the farms lay peaceful and content, like trustful women
sleeping in a tiger’s cage.</p>

<p>Lanty looked at the Lugg, that tremendous thwarter
of the tides, and thought of his father. The project
had aroused a storm of controversy at the time, out of
which the thing itself had emerged triumphant. Men
had pronounced it a risk to the whole coast, and time
had proved them wrong. Lancaster had vindicated
himself, leaving the bank as his monument, for, in
looking out to it each day, the marsh saw also the
dead who had planned it. They were not afraid of it
there. Because a Lancaster had built it they trusted
it, resting tranquilly on his word. It was in their
simple confidence that his real monument was raised.</p>

<p>The son came at last to the channel of the Wythe,
hurrying to sea past the foot of Ladyford, and from
there he hailed the farm, shattering the stillness and
causing even himself to start. Somebody answered
from behind the buildings, and presently a tall boy
appeared on the bank, and scrambled down to the
boat below. This was Dockeray’s youngest son, the
only one at home, and Lanty wondered, watching him
pull across, what he and his parents thought of the
Whinnerah complication. He had come with no
definite plan, after all—simply to see how the land lay,
and whether a timely word might in any way be
possible. Certainly he doubted both the opportunity
and his own wisdom. If the girl were as good-looking
as her brother, he thought idly, she might be forgiven
a little petulant coquetting with destiny.</p>

<p>Rowly greeted him with a smile as he grounded the
boat, and made conversation readily enough as they
went over. His parents were well, and the married
brothers away. His sister? Yes, she was at home,
now—had been for some time. Oh, yes, he was glad
to have her. It was a bit lonely at Ladyford of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
winter’s night, and Francey was champion at the
piano and singing. He liked a song himself, and so
did the old folks. They were well, too, at Ninekyrkes,
barring old Wolf. He feared he looked like breaking
up fast; but anyhow it was time he had a rest, and
let Lup take hold. Ever since the pneumonia he’d
been a different man. But that was all; no sign or
hint of how matters stood, or on which side his
sympathies lay. Lanty knew only too well the deeps
covered by the apparent guilelessness of the breed,
and asked no leading questions. It was early work for
that, in any case. Better bide his time until he had
seen the girl herself.</p>

<p>Michael Dockeray was waiting on the bank when
they pulled in, spare and upright, with wise, quiet
eyes and little to say. A totally different type from
old Wolf—this; refined and tactful where the other
was blunt and unafraid; strong enough, too, but with
none of Wolf’s added violence. Yet the two had
always been friends, often disagreeing, but turning to
each other for help as naturally as to one of their own.</p>

<p>He met Lanty’s grasp warmly, and they moved on
up to the house, leaving Rowly to get the boat ashore,
for the tide would be on the turn before long. The
agent came but seldom to the far marsh, and he caught
a wave of welcoming excitement as he approached—figures
passing from kitchen to dairy in a cheerful
flurry that yet allowed time for a peep through the
nearest window at the coming guest. Mrs. Dockeray’s
voice could be heard running the full gamut of agitated
instruction, dropping to a last whisper behind the
pantry door concerning the new strawberry jam.
Then she appeared, all pleasant smiles and hearty
kindness, and Lanty’s homelessness was taken up into
her motherly arms and smothered out of existence.
Through the half-open door he had a glimpse of a
smooth, dark head and a trim figure, and a desire for
flight came upon him, in spite of the new strawberry
jam. His task, vaguely irritating before, became
suddenly impossible and grotesque.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
He consented to sit in the parlour, making polite
conversation with his host while the ordered ceremonies
went forward beyond, but he refused to be given tea
there, and was glad when the summons came at last
from the atmosphere of wool mats and honesty to the
artistic rightness of the kitchen. Across the cool
picture of yellowed walls, white-stoned flags, shining
linen and china, Francey Dockeray’s face stood out
cooler still, and as he shook her by the hand he felt
painfully clumsy and inadequate before her pleasant
self-possession. She knew why he had come—he guessed
it from the faint satirical twist in her otherwise charming
smile, from the swift summing-up of her gray eyes.
The business-matter which he had put forward to her
father would not pass muster with her, he felt certain
of that. He could have dealt with the ordinary
farmer’s daughter; he knew to a turn the phrase and
manner to adopt with success, but they would not
apply here. Wolf had been right when he used the
word “quality” of Francey Dockeray. Her ease of
manner had the simplicity of true good breeding, and
it was to this that he had unwillingly paid tribute.
But she was aloof, as he had said. Affectionate towards
her parents, thoughtful for the guest, interested
and attentive, she was yet, in some inexplicable fashion,
outside and away from them all. Lancaster liked his
errand less with every minute that passed.</p>

<p>It was inevitable, of course, that the conversation,
veering from land-politics to wrestling and singing-practice
for the benefit of the young folks, and back
again to the farm, should turn at last to their neighbours.
As soon as Whinnerah’s name was mentioned,
Lanty took his first tentative step.</p>

<p>“You’ll know, I suppose, that Wolf’s talking of
leaving?” he asked casually. “Lup’s off to Canada,
he tells me, and that means the old folks clearing out
of the farm. I’m sorry for both pieces of news.
Whinnerahs are old friends. We can always do with
the right sort, and Lup’s one of the best.”</p>

<p>He sent a straying glance round the group, only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
to meet the same blank impassiveness that had resisted
his efforts crossing channel. It seemed as if,
in the eyes of her family at least, Francey could do
no wrong.</p>

<p>“Ay, the pneumonia did for Wolf!” Dockeray
admitted sadly. “I’ll be loth to see the Whinnerahs
go. We’ve known each other a sight o’ years, now, and
when it comes to old company taking its hand off
the plough, I’m like to think my own time won’t be
so long, neither.”</p>

<p>“Nay, now, master!” Mrs. Dockeray put in quickly.
“What, you’re a deal younger than Wolf, and as lish
as a whip! You’ve no call to talk of giving up yet
awhile. Not but what you’ll be missing them all
sadly, I doubt, as I will myself. I’m not one for
taking up with new stuff, an’ I’ve sort of grown with
Whinnerahs. I’m not saying, though, but what it’ll
do young Lup a deal o’ good to see a bit of the world.
He sticks away in the old groove till he gets that tied
with his tongue you’d think he hadn’t two brains to
rub one at back o’ t’other!”</p>

<p>“Lup’s right enough, mother!” young Rowly put
in indignantly. “Lup’s head’s as full o’ meat as most.
You’ve no need to call him out of his name!”</p>

<p>“Nay, why I’ve nowt against the lad, not I! But
he’d do with a shake an’ a slake an’ a shine with a
polisher, after a manner of speaking. Look at Brack
Holliday, now! <i>Yon’s</i> a lad worth running to see of
a Saturday night! Canada done that; happen it’ll
do something for the other an’ all. He hadn’t much
in the way of schoolin’, hadn’t Lup—he was that
stuck on the farm—and it doesn’t do not to keep a
few manners put by when there’s call for ’em. Why,
there’s whiles I’ve heard him talking with our Francey
there, he so rough and she that nice-spoken—though
I say it as shouldn’t, she being my own lass—there’s
times I’ve felt right-down sorry Lup shouldn’t have no
more chance of bettering himself than his own hired
man.”</p>

<p>Lanty’s circular glance caught the faintest flush<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
on Francey’s cheek, and passed to meet Mrs. Dockeray’s
glance seeking his own; and it came to him, in a flash
of inspiration, that she was on Lup’s side and her men-folk
with her, that the wise mother-mind had its own
method of pulling the strings, while the others stood
apart, committing themselves to nothing. The matter
struck him suddenly as a charming, homely comedy of
courtship—no more; and he planted a further step
with a firmer tread.</p>

<p>“I was doubly surprised to hear of his departure,
because it was quite other news I’d looked for. Folk
had it he was getting ready to marry and settle down,
and I thought the lady in luck, whoever she might be.
I was misinformed, I suppose? Strange how these
tales get round!”</p>

<p>A certain uneasiness became apparent in both
Michael and Rowly at this, but Mrs. Dockeray never
turned a hair.</p>

<p>“Ay, well, courtin’ he might be, like enough, but it
isn’t every lass would look at Lup, as I mentioned a
minute ago, for all he’s a good enough lad and steady
as yon shuppon. He’s not everybody’s choice in these
days o’ lettering and figuring. There’s a many as’ll
seek to look higher than just poor Lup Whinnerah!”</p>

<p>She fixed him again, and he nodded assent, seeing
that it was expected of him; and then, from her post
at the window, where she had moved at the end of
the meal, he met Francey’s clear gaze. She stood half-turned
to the casement and the stretch of sand beyond,
her pale cheek to the brilliant geraniums on the wide
ledge, and in her eyes, as they rested on his, something
of scorn and yet of wounded appeal. He felt
the blood rise to his face as he looked, conscious of
having outraged both her feelings and his own good
taste. The type he understood would have taken him
in jest, or retreated from the room in dudgeon; not
have remained without retort, gently contemptuous
and quietly hurt. He changed the subject abruptly,
wishing the Whinnerahs and their affairs at Jericho.</p>

<p>Lup’s name dropped like a stone, but the question<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
of matrimony still hung in the air, for Michael himself
came back to it after a lengthy discussion upon the
late danger of plague from Irish cattle.</p>

<p>“Ay, there’s many a knock-down blow lying in
wait for the poor farmer!” he observed, shaking his
head over a new and harrowing tale. “But it’s a
decent enough life for them as is framed for it and
knows how to take it standing. It’s done well enough
by me. I’ve a fairish farm and a just landlord, and
the sort of missis a man’ll be put about to part with
when the time comes for his last ride to church!”
He looked across at his wife with a mild twinkle. “Not
but what she’s a rough side to her tongue, and a mighty
short stock o’ patience for them as doesn’t see same
ways as herself;—but there’s only two sorts o’ wives,
Mr. Lancaster—them as a man’s fain to be shot of,
an’ them as he’d be right fain to be shot <i>for</i>—an’ yon
last’s my missis, sir, and a good bit over!”</p>

<p>Francey left the window, and laid her hands on his
shoulders for a moment, her face lightly smiling and
tender. Then she was gone from the room, while
Mrs. Dockeray, with the suspicion of a shake in her
voice, defended her character for patience.</p>

<p>“Eh, well, I reckon we’re as easy as most!” she
admitted at last with her cheerful laugh. “You’d
do no harm to take copy from us, Mr. Lancaster.
We’ve been looking for you to get wed, any time these
last ten years!”</p>

<p>Lanty was used to the suggestion, and repudiated it
without embarrassment.</p>

<p>“I’m not a marrying man, I doubt!” he answered;
and, even as he spoke, felt a surge of envy sweep over
him at the picture of mutual need before him. “Any
more than Lup!” he added, with meaning, and there
came another pause, during which Rowly slipped out
after his sister.</p>

<p>“You know what’s to do, sir, I reckon?” the mother
asked presently, as Lancaster waited for his challenge
to be accepted; and at his brief—“Wolf told me something”—she
unburdened herself of the situation, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
Michael stared straight before him with his wise eyes,
rocking gently from time to time in his cushioned
chair.</p>

<p>“Whinnerah he come across rampin’ fit to kill
himself, saying as how our lass had been playing fast
an’ loose with his lad, and there was talk o’ Canada
and quitting the farm an’ such-like! He was set on
our putting our foot down, Michael an’ me, and giving
Francey a piece of our minds, but we told him that
hadn’t never been our way with her, and it wasn’t
likely we’d begin now; so he took off again in a rare
tantrum, an’ that’s all there is to it. It’s true, as he
says, as we’ve always made sure she and Lup was
courtin’, but we didn’t ask questions, taking it that
she’d speak when she’d a mind. I’d be glad to see her
wed the lad, ay, an’ so would Michael here, though
I’m not saying she mightn’t do better. But if she’s
not set on having him, she shan’t be driven to it, as
long as there’s folks at Ladyford to her back. I’m
real sorry for Wolf and Lup—ay, an’ poor Martha!—and
I’d give a deal to see the lad stop, but our own
barn comes first, and she shall suit herself, Mr.
Lancaster.”</p>

<p>And Michael said: “Ay. Yon’s the way of it.
Yon’s right!” rocking gently from time to time in his
cushioned chair.</p>

<p>“Well, it seems a pity,” Lanty said at last, reluctantly
making ready to go, “but I’m still hoping
things will right themselves. It’s natural a girl should
like to be consulted, though I shouldn’t have thought
it was just a touch of pride with your daughter. She
looks too fine a character for anything as small-minded
as that.”</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t only pride, Mr. Lancaster! It’s something a
deal stronger,—it’s love upside down. We’ve nobody
but ourselves to thank, as I tell Michael. It’s the
schoolin’ as done it. We’d a bit of money saved, and
we took a fancy to have her finished like a lady, but
I’m not so sure, nowadays, as we did the right thing
by her. It’s hard, Mr. Lancaster, when you think a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
deal o’ your own, not to want to give them something
better than you’ve had yourself, but I’ll not say as I
think it’s always wise or kind, leastways, for a woman.
A man, happen, can go an’ fight his own way in the
world, but if a woman’s got to bide at home, the
schoolin’s likely learned her nowt but hankering for
what’s out of her reach. Not but what Francey’s been
biddable enough, but I’ve kept my eye on her. I’ve
been biding my time for this, an’ now it’s come. We’ve
made her different of our own will, and we’ve no right
to expect her to do as we’d have done. It’s us that’s
to blame—an’ the learning. It makes a woman look
at a man like a new sort o’ lesson-book. It starts her
wondering what she feels instead o’ just feeling. It sets
her seeing with her eyes an’ not with her heart. It’s
not just brains you want for dealing wi’ men-folk, sir.
It’s something as feels in the dark with blind eyes,
something as sharp to hark as yon collie-pup, as soft
to touch as a mother’s hands! Francey’s looking an’
not letting herself feel, and till she’s learned that
looking doesn’t count in love, there’s nobody can
help her. Nobody but Lup—and, happen, life—can
set her right.”</p>

<p>“You’ll likely be giving them a look-in at Ninekyrkes,
sir, as you’re here?” she added, following him
to the door. “They’re terrible down, an’ it would
cheer them up a bit. Wolf’s that set on your family,
you’d happen think it was Royalty, to hark to him!
He saw a deal o’ your father, yon time as the Lugg was
so long building—Mr. Lancaster used to stop many a
night along with him—an’ he’ll crack for a week about
it if happen he gets the chance. He’d swear with his
eyes shut to everything your father ever did—says
there’ll never be his like again. Not but what he
thinks a sight o’ <i>you</i> an’ all, sir! You’ll look in?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll step over, now I’m here, but of course
I’ll say nothing of what you’ve told me. If they
really mean leaving, we must get things fixed up.
Wolf said his wife had taken to looking ahead for
trouble. Is that so, do you know?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>He saw a half-embarrassed glance pass between the
two.</p>

<p>“She was always a bit of a worrit,” Michael said
at last, rather hurriedly, “an’ this’ll have likely got
on her nerves. I’ll set you a piece of the way, sir.”</p>

<p>Wondering, Lancaster followed him out into the
heavy evening.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>THE TROUBLE SHAPING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was milking-time when Lanty left Ladyford, with
Dockeray beside him, and they met the cattle coming
in to the shippons. Their slow swing across the yard
added to the drowsy oppression of the day. It was
as if he walked in sleep along the narrow sea-road
linking the two farms. The flat land behind was in
good cultivation. When it was turned by the plough,
the share came out clean of rust and shining like silver.
A big plantation stood away towards Wythebarrow,
hiding the highway between. A wide cut was cloven
betwixt the far meadows. There was no sign of the
tide as yet, and out on the dry sands the Lugg still lay
meaningless and bare.</p>

<p>Ninekyrkes was nearer the open sea than Ladyford,
less sheltered, less homely, less pleasant to the eye.
The rough, sturdy house stood up bravely to the
winds. There were flowers round Dockeray’s, and an
orchard behind it. Whinnerah’s had neither. It was
built for storm and stress and fierce happenings, and
bore upon its forehead the mark of an abiding-place of
Fate.</p>

<p>Wolf came round as they appeared, and after a
brief greeting Michael turned home. Lancaster saw
him go with strange reluctance. The grim farm and
its grim tenant fostered a sense of tragedy lying in
wait, gathering itself to spring; but he roused his
business-side determinedly, and kept strictly to technicalities
as he started on his tour of inspection. Yet still
the hand of tragedy obtruded through all. It was
pitiful to hear the old man reverting to plans for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
future as if the doom of dismissal had never been
pronounced. He would stop at some field or fence,
pointing out what he meant to do next year or later,
and Lancaster listened patiently, or brought him back
gently to the real state of things. His self-consciousness
with regard to Michael’s daughter disappeared
in face of the full situation, and his anger grew against
the girl, who, for some trivial reason, could stubbornly
rob a failing man of his earned desire. For Lup he had
sympathy, if a good deal of impatience. He was
strong enough, surely, to take what he wanted; yet
perhaps it needed something finer than mere strength
to capture Francey Dockeray. In any case, he should
know his own business best.</p>

<p>They got to the house at last, and within it he felt
again the marked contrast with Ladyford. Here, in
the kitchen so similar in many ways, the cheerful peace
was changed for hinted dread, emanating, he concluded
at length, from the frail figure in the chair by
the window. He had known Mrs. Whinnerah all his
life, and he was not afraid of her unsmiling welcome,
but to-night he felt that something hidden suffered
and watched behind her chill reserve. The sense of
it was so strong that it claimed his thoughts even
while he carried on the usual conversational exchange.</p>

<p>They were a pathetic pair, he thought, looking from
one bent figure to the other. Wolf was a sad enough
picture, a fine man gone to wreck in a few devastating
months, but the pathos of the woman went deeper.
The hard life on the marsh had broken her long since,
stolen her youth in the first years of marriage, crippled
her with rheumatism, stamped on her thin face that
look of passionless endurance which can be seen in
many a farmer’s wife who has found her burden too
heavy and gone on bearing it. She had been pretty,
once. In the line of her cheek and the set of her head
was still a beauty of refinement absent from Francey’s
mother over at Ladyford, and the thin fingers of her
worn hands were curiously sensitive and suggestive of
a rare intuition. But that was all that was left to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
her. She was finished, as Wolf was finished, and the
one thing that life might yet have held for them was
to be taken away. Lanty wondered how Lup could
look at them, night after night, sitting there hopeless,
and steel his heart to the unbreathed prayer, even
though sacrifice might mean daily crucifixion, with
the love denied so close at hand. But Lup himself
was part of the cruel situation. He did not come to
it from outside, as Lancaster came, with fresh eyes full
of pity.</p>

<p>Remembering both Wolf’s words and the Dockerays’
embarrassment, he found himself noting the old
woman’s constant and fixed gaze out to sea. Her
faded eyes were still clear, and the large pupils had
the effect of dark pebbles seen through deep pools.
Time after time he succeeded in drawing them to his
own face, but, his question answered, they returned
instantly to some invisible point beyond. Wolf had
said she was watching for something, and it certainly
seemed like it, for the glance was not the wandering
one of custom, but a stare of genuine expectation,
suggesting held breath and stiffened muscles. Wolf
looked at her uneasily at times, and when she became
conscious of his gaze she would bring her own with an
effort to the guest, but always, always it went back.
The sensation of mystery deepened, and Lancaster
stirred restlessly under its touch. The sky had
darkened and then filled with fire, and beneath the
dull thunder-glow the houses on Bytham Knott looked
like flakes of snow dropped on a sullen slab of granite.
The thin trees stood like dumb sentinels of fear; the
green of the fields smote the eye; a sudden clash of
milk-pails from without set every nerve leaping, and
then the stillness sank again. And the sands and
the bank were stiller than the air. The only moving
thing was the shining, quivering line far away to the
west.</p>

<p>Mrs. Whinnerah made no complaint of the approaching
change. She was ready to go, not with the decision
of personal choice, but with the apathy of one led by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
destiny. Lanty asked at last where they thought of
moving when the time came for breaking-up. There
was a pause after the question, and he saw Wolf’s
eyes travel to his wife, as if, in this moment, some
urgent problem must be solved, but she gave him no
assistance.</p>

<p>“You’ll think it queer, likely,” he began, filling his
pipe with slow fingers, “but I’m hoping you’ll not say
no to an old man’s wish. There’s yon cottage your
father built, you’ll think on—that on the new land as
they call the ‘Pride.’ It’s been empty a good bit, but
it’s taken no harm. The key’s here, and I’ve had a
look round now and then. Folk say it’s over lonesome;
they get flate at night, hearkening to the sea, them as
hasn’t been bred by it an’ learned to like it. I’d
never rest without the song of it coming and going,
but there’s folk can’t abide it. Well, I’ve got a fancy
for that cottage, Mr. Lancaster. It’s nigh on Ninekyrkes
land, and I’d be able to reach an eye over the
old spot from the door. With a bit o’ practice I’ll
likely learn not to mind seeing other folk at my job.
It’ll not be for that long, I doubt.”</p>

<p>“Come, you’re good for many a year yet!” Lancaster
put in, as cheerfully as he could. “I can have
the cottage put in order for you if you’re really set on
it, but don’t you think you’d be wiser to pitch your
tent somewhere else altogether? Living within a
stone’s-throw will only set you hankering after the
farm. You’d be happier away. What has your wife
to say to it?”</p>

<p>He turned to the woman, but before she could
answer there came a sharp crack right across the empty
sands, and with a strangled cry she half rose to her
feet, gripping the wooden arms of the chair, her face
livid and her arms rigid, her glassy eyes fixed on the
inscrutable beyond.</p>

<p>“It’s through!” she said in a choked voice, so full
of horror that it drew Lancaster to his feet beside her,
but Wolf sat still and snarled from his chair.</p>

<p>“Yon’s thunder, nowt else! Look ye there!” and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
as a fierce flicker of lightning danced down the pane,
she sank back into her chair, biting her lips to steady
them, and knotting her trembling hands together on
her knee. She was calm again almost immediately,
and Lancaster, at the window, watching the blue
daggers stabbing the dead waste, and hearkening to
the long rattle of charging clouds, marvelled that she
showed no further signs of agitation. Shock after
shock broke overhead, leaving her unmoved, and the
vivid flashes scarcely shut her eyes. It was not the
storm that had frightened her, he told himself. What
was it?</p>

<p>The almost running roar made conversation impossible,
so he stood silent, watching the tempest sweep
along the open space before him. The passion of it
seemed grotesque, as wreaked upon a lifeless thing
beyond the reach of hurt. It died away at last in
tired, angry spasms and slow gleams, and the thick
silence came again into the heavy sky.</p>

<p>When it was spent, Lanty turned to say good-bye,
hoping to make home before the storm returned,
circling on its tracks like a driven hare, but as he
reached the door a strange thing happened.</p>

<p>Through the stillness dropped like a muffling shroud
came a new sound, smooth, stealthy, swift, a soft
sound as of shod wheels, swept wings and subdued
speech; and in the same moment Mrs. Whinnerah
collapsed in her chair, until he saw the thin, gray hair
coiled at the nape of her neck. With an exclamation,
half of pity, half wrath, Wolf turned and went back
to her, and, looking out, Lanty saw the bore sweeping
up over the vanishing sand. It was small to-day,
innocent and slim, with a crest of white on its smooth
head, but in the deadly certainty of its advance, the
unhasting speed with which it met the sand and took
it, there was a sinister promise of mightier power held
back. The insidious reminder of its faint wash was
almost as terrible as the shout of battle with which
the winter tides came in. It slid lightly along the foot
of the Lugg with barely a ripple, and the bank looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
down almost unaware, like a dreaming graybeard at a
child playing round his knees.</p>

<p>Behind him, with a troubled sense of intrusion, he
could hear Wolf’s voice, impatient and distressed,
coaxing the crouching figure in the chair.</p>

<p>“It’s by, lass—past an’ safe, by now—a whyet
enough water with barely a lift to it. Nay, what
you must be daft to take on like this! It’ll stand
many a long year after we’re under the sod. You’ve
no call to fret. It’s a Lancaster’s job, Martha, as sure
as a gun an’ as right as a bobbin!” He looked up
apologetically. “You’ll not take it amiss, sir? She’s
always like this at the turn of the tide.”</p>

<p>Lanty sympathised as well as he could, but when he
would have held out his hand in farewell, she shrank
away and hid her face once more.</p>

<p>“The Lancaster hand!” she muttered, winding her
fingers in the woollen antimacassar. “Oh, God!
How long? How long?”</p>

<p>With a pleading look, Wolf drew him out, and he
went gladly enough, bewildered by the whole situation.
There was mystery somewhere, and he did not
like to ask the cause.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Whinnerah seems thoroughly upset,” he
ventured at last, in a matter-of-fact tone. “Living
so long by the sea has got on her nerves, and I don’t
wonder! It must be pretty drear out here on a rough
night. You should get her away for a change,—she
has a sister over at Bortun, hasn’t she? It doesn’t
do to play with these things. If she keeps like this,
you’ll surely never think of taking the cottage?”</p>

<p>Over the old man’s shoulder he could see in the
distance the little gray building behind the Lugg, that
some mocker had ticketed “Lancaster’s Pride.” It
had had many tenants, but none had stayed very long.
Their courage had not been equal to the dark nights
on the lonely waste—nights, when behind the wall a full
sea surged and swayed, claiming the land that man
had robbed. It stood empty, now, waiting stronger
spirits, and it was to this place of fear that Wolf’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
heart turned, for from its windows he could look to
Ninekyrkes all day long.</p>

<p>“Nay, the missis’ll do well enough,” he said, in
answer to Lancaster’s speech. “She started yon
worriting job nigh on a year back, a matter of a few
week afore Brack Holliday landed home. He made
such a stir, it kind o’ fixed it in my mind! She’ll
likely mend after a bit. Anyway, she’ll not quit the
marsh no more than me, that’s sure an’ certain!”</p>

<p>“Why, but man, it’s bad enough for her at Ninekyrkes!”
the other argued. “It’ll be a good few
hundred times worse at the Pride. You’ll never get
her to go.”</p>

<p>“She’ll gang where I gang!” Wolf said obstinately.
“Offer her any other spot on the estate, and see for
yourself. She’ll bide all right.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t say I think you’re wise. Suppose
I won’t let you the cottage? I’ve more than half a
mind to refuse.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll see his lordship, Mr. Lancaster! It’s
not for a steward to be looking awry at a good tenant!”
He added, “Begging your pardon, sir!” with instant
contrition.</p>

<p>Lancaster nodded assurance.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Wolf. But I wish you’d reconsider
your decision. I don’t like the idea of your
roosting away in that desolate spot.”</p>

<p>“It’s desolate, sir, but it’s safe enough. <i>You’ve</i>
no call to fear the Lugg, surely?”</p>

<p>“Why, no, the bank’s all right!” Lanty answered,
with a smile. “There’s never anything my father
did but holds good to this day. But, all the same, I
don’t want you at the Pride.”</p>

<p>“Ay, but all the same you’ll let it me, sir! It’s
this way, Mr. Lancaster. Your father, when he’d
made sure the Lugg was standing, he’d just time to
build yon lile cot afore he died. He’d framed for a
many more, but they had to bide. An’, near about the
last time he was down, he says to me (I’d been a deal
with him up an’ down the marsh, and he was the best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
friend I had, but yon’s an old story you don’t need to
hear), he says to me: ‘Wolf,’ says he, ‘yon’ll be just
the spot for you if ever you come to quit the farm.
I’ll have been in my grave many a year by then, but
my bank’ll see to you for me. I’d like to think of
you in the little house, for there’s never a stone nor a
plank but will call me to mind. Not but what I know
you’ll not forget. I’ll never really die while the Lugg
stands and Wolf Whinnerah’s over sod!’ You’ll not
say no after that, sir?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll think it over,” Lanty answered reluctantly.
“By the way, I haven’t had a word yet
with the girl. Perhaps I’ll catch her as I go back,
though I doubt it’s no use. Good-bye, and I wish to
goodness you’d change your minds all round!”</p>

<p>He left him at the yard gate, and strode off along
the road. On the other side of the Let the tide lapped
tenderly. Deep in frowning thought, he was startled
by a voice speaking his name, and, looking up, saw
Francey Dockeray on the grassy barrier above him.</p>

<small>THE TOOL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> saw her for a moment poised against the brooding
sky, and then she dropped down the bank to his side.
They stood alone on the desolate strip of road twisting
whitely between black peat, green mound, and brown
sand. Midway from farm to farm they met—a
fitting point, it seemed to him, for the peculiar arbitration
he had in hand.</p>

<p>“Rowly’s at the boat, sir, if you’re wanting him,”
she said politely, and he answered with a curt word of
thanks. Then—“They’re in a bad way at Ninekyrkes,”
he began, without preamble. “They seem
gone to pieces altogether, both Wolf and his wife.
It’s hard on an old couple, of course, when it comes to
losing both their home and their only child.”</p>

<p>She looked away to the crag behind, and made no
reply.</p>

<p>“I’ve just been round the place with the old man,”
he went on, “and it was pitiable to see how he kept
forgetting he’d got to go. It was like turning the knife
in the wound to keep reminding him how things
were. It’s hard, as I said. He might have had his
last days in peace.”</p>

<p>Still she did not answer; only her gaze, turned
inland, grew troubled and hard pressed.</p>

<p>“It seems so unnecessary!” He felt suddenly
impatient before her silent resistance of his efforts.
“Lup’s place is here; that’s plain enough to anybody
with half a conscience. He’s fond of the old folks,
too. It isn’t as if they didn’t get on. Normally,
he’d never have thought of leaving them. Can’t
something be done? Can’t somebody help?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>She gave a sharp sigh, as if forced against her will
over old ground already trodden to weariness, and
brought her eyes to his as they rested on her full of
demand and penetration.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better be frank with each other,
Mr. Lancaster?” she asked gently. “You’ve heard
the story—I feel sure of that—and you want to try to
talk me round. That’s so, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard some sort of an account—yes; and it
looks as if the key of the situation lay with you. Of
course, you’ll say it’s no business of mine, and from
one point of view it certainly isn’t, but when old
friends are in trouble one wants to stretch a hand.
I wish you’d tell me why you did it—why you went
back on Lup Whinnerah just when he needed you
most. You’ll not deny you went back on him, I
suppose?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t deny it.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, there’s hope!” He smiled with
quick relief. “You’re surely not the sort to play
down upon a good lad like Lup? You’ll never break
up his home for the sake of a whim or a foolish twinge
of vanity?”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to break up his home. I’ve tried
to dissuade him from going away. He could stop,
if he chose. I can’t see that I make any real
difference.”</p>

<p>“You make all the difference.” He was speaking
gently enough, now. “We like to have married men
on the farms, for one thing; and even supposing Lup
did stop on, what sort of a life would it be for him,
with you always within reach? You’re all so dependent
on each other, out here. He’s been over-hasty, I
consider, but I can’t find it in my heart to blame him
greatly. Sticking by the man, of course, you’ll say?
Well, perhaps; but in this case there’s reason. Come,
Miss Francey, think better of it. If you care for him
at all, you’ll never let him go.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not keep him,” she said, and they fell silent.</p>

<p>Then—“Why?” he asked again. “But why?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>She smiled faintly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know why—not altogether. It’s true
that it’s partly pride, I suppose—I’m not sure. I
do care for Lup, and I’d promised to marry him, but
when his father put it all into plain words, spoke out
and told me to fix the date, all the glamour went,
somehow. He had it so cut and dried—I felt as if
I were being sold. It meant no more to him than a
change of stock at a May fair. I’d have had to say
no if it had killed me. He meant all right—of course
I know that—and it would have been right for most,
but it wasn’t for me. They wouldn’t treat one of your
class like that, would they? But that’s the way of
mine, and I’d no right to resent it, I suppose, only
I’ve been made over and differently in those long
years at school. I couldn’t accept it as perhaps
I ought to have done. It hurt something in me that
I didn’t know was there, something that wouldn’t
be touched. That was part of the reason, I think.
Not all.”</p>

<p>“And the rest?” he asked, at last.</p>

<p>“The rest is Lup’s, sir. I can’t tell you that.
I don’t see it clear myself, as I said. Put it at pride
altogether, if you like.”</p>

<p>“What’s pride, if you care?” he argued. “Let
that go by the board! You can, if you try. And
the other thing, too, whatever it is. For Lup’s sake—for
the old folks’ sake——”</p>

<p>“I can’t. I can’t.”</p>

<p>“You’ll not regret it.”</p>

<p>“I can’t—that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not here to marry you against your
will!” he growled, aggrieved at the deadlock. “If
you won’t, you won’t, and there’s an end of it. I’d
not be so hard on you if I thought the change would
mean getting Mrs. Whinnerah away altogether, but
it seems that Wolf is set on taking the Pride.”</p>

<p>“The Pride?” They had begun to walk slowly
towards the boat, but now she half stopped, looking
up at him anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>“That’s his idea. I can’t very well refuse him, if
he really means it, but it looks to me a bad move for
the wife. Even Ninekyrkes seems too much for her
nerves, as it is. You’ve seen her lately, I suppose?
Can you tell me what’s at the back of it all?”</p>

<p>She quickened her step, looking down.</p>

<p>“She’s getting old, sir, and she imagines things.
You mustn’t pay any heed, Mr. Lancaster. It only
worries Wolf if you do.”</p>

<p>“Well, I must say you’re a happy family over here
at present!” he grumbled, as they came down the
shore. “I might as well have stopped away, for all
the good I’ve done. You’ll be sorry for this, some
day, Miss Francey!”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry now!” she answered, with so much
pathos and helpless appeal in her voice that he was
silenced. Scrambling into the boat, he was rowed
away across the now wide stretch of water. The first
shot of the new battery burst from the sky as he
reached the other side, and through the playing
lightning he saw Francey Dockeray still on the bank,
with the blackness of all doom around and above
her.</p>

<small>HAMER’S HUT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dandy Shaw</span> looked round the Watters drawing-room
with a little twist of the lips. She was perched
on a high oak stool, with her feet on the rungs, and
through the Chippendale mirror opposite she could
see both her own figure and its setting. It was afternoon,
and under the looped yellow silk blinds the sun
pattered on dark wood and faint brocades, a carpet
hushed as moss, elusive little water-colours, china
ephemeral as frost-breath, books with the colouring
of rare gems. There were no photographs in the room,
and there was no silver, no flotsam and jetsam of
Christmas and birthday offerings, but there were
flowers everywhere, not massed with heavy ballroom
effects, nor set at conventional intervals like a well-drilled
regiment, but leading the eye on with unexpected
thrills of pleasure from one delicate single
shade to another, like tiny semitones in a fairy scale.
From without, where the river crept beneath the dark
splendour of turned beeches edging the terrace, the
long, low, gray-faced house with its plain windows
looked almost asleep, but there was a very active
brain at work within.</p>

<p>Dandy—otherwise Anne—had no need to fear her
image in the mirror, but she frowned at it, nevertheless.
Even the image seemed joyously alive, with
soft, bright hair, and blue eyes full of candid goodwill;
and nothing about it clashed at first sight with
its surroundings, yet she glanced from it to the old
walls with amused yet abashed and apologetic resentment.
For the first time in her life, Dandy Shaw was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
discovering that there are things which mean more
than people.</p>

<p>From the still house and the simple, beautiful room
her thoughts went back to Halsted, her late home on
the outskirts of a Lancashire town—to the overwhelming
magnificence of its <i lang="fr">ménage</i>, the long, rich
meals, the endless contrivances for comfort, the stream
of guests, the intricate programmes of amusement.
She saw the big, red pile, with the shining cars slurring
up its drive, the long lines of hothouses, the priceless
roses, the precious orchids flung into elaborate schemes
of colour. It was all rich and splendid and inviting,
luxurious and perfectly organised; but Watters cared
for none of these things.</p>

<p>It was pale and gray and plain and cool and utterly
aloof. It did not care a toss whether you looked at
it or not, so of course you always did, leaning over
the humped bridge, and wondering what ghosts moved
in the darkened rooms and met by moonlight on the
terrace. If you tried to bring a car up its twisting,
cross-grained drive, the odds were you would find
yourself in the river or a clump of clipped yews as
old as Ernuin the Priest. And the roses at Watters
would have died of sheer disgust in the cosmopolitan
atmosphere of a rose-show marquee. They grew and
scrambled and climbed in their own strong-willed
fashion, clothing cold stone with hearts of deep orange,
flinging arches of tender pink or glowing crimson against
opal skies, or lifting single, dewy heads like pale lamps
in the hushed garden after sunset. And at any but
simple food it looked rigidly askance, loftily permitting
the butcher to drop his beef and mutton, and condescending
to game, as a country house of standing,
but shutting shocked eyelids upon French ménus
and foreign cheeses. Anything <i lang="fr">bisqué</i> or <i lang="fr">braisé</i> or
<i lang="fr">soufflé</i> or <i lang="fr">au gratin</i> scarcely dared trust itself near
the stove, and a pot of <i lang="fr">foie-gras</i> had positively to be
smuggled.</p>

<p>It was a curious impulse that had driven the
Lancashire tradesman from the home of his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
creating to one with which he had apparently nothing
in common. Less than a year ago, Dandy had found
him on the Halsted drive, with his hands in his pockets
and his hat on the back of his head, surveying the
symbol of wealth with a puzzled frown.</p>

<p>“There’s something wrong, Dandy Anne!” he
broke out, as she slid a hand through his arm. “It’s
strong and it’s good, and it’s warm and it’s cool, and
comfortable and convenient and clean, but it isn’t
anything else. It doesn’t make you think of the past
and the future. It doesn’t make you want to throw
up your hat one minute and dry your eyes on your
coat-sleeve the next. It’ll never have any troubles
or joys bigger than an insurance-card or a mayoral
invitation. It’s smug—that’s what it is! It doesn’t
feel—it <i>can’t</i>, and so it can’t make you feel, either.
When a man’s getting on in years, he wants the sort
of house that can show him how to grow old kindly.
This red elephant would be smug and smiling while
I was tottering into the grave. Let’s go and find
a hut, Dandy Anne, where I can grow old gently.”</p>

<p>And Watters, for some reason known only to himself,
had seemed to him just that “hut.” He had had it
decorated by an artist, who, recognising the individuality
of the place, seemed to have listened in secret to
its whispered wants; and when it was finished, Hamer
Shaw strode happily up and down it, a burly, incongruous
figure with its hat on the back of its head, satisfied
to the very marrow, and growing younger every day.
He had opened his eyes in a Westmorland cottage,
and though he had left it so speedily that it was scarcely
worth mention, some power, biding its time, had called
him back, to his passionate content. Mrs. Shaw was
of the type that belongs nowhere but to the absorbing
house-world of the moment, and she had borne the
transplanting cheerfully enough, if not with her husband’s
bubbling ecstasy. But to Dandy it was almost
as terrific an experience as a total change of planet.</p>

<p>Bred in Lancashire, educated in London, finished
abroad, she had no single tie with her new life and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
surroundings. She had been perfectly happy at
Halsted, liking the constant excitement, the flow of
money, the crowd of guests. She had understood
everybody, and they had understood her. She had
been an excellent hostess, and a very charming uncrowned
queen, with not only Halsted, but all her
circle at her feet. She had lived quickly and strongly,
a little noisily, perhaps, but very vividly; and now,
at the age of twenty-four, she was flung out of the
rush into still water. Cessation may prove as distracting
as revolution, and after five months she
was even yet eminently perplexed. She had put no
stone in the way of her father’s sudden desire, cheerfully
resigning the old life for the new, for she was a
happy creature with an interest in the world at large
that would have stood the shock of almost any change.
But this had proved so puzzling and disconcerting,—yielded
so many emotions of an unexpected nature!
Not only was she no longer a queen; she was scarcely
an individual. With her somewhat exceptional powers
of clear vision she soon discovered that. She was
“the new girl from somewhere awful—I forget where;
daughter of the new people at Watters—I forget
who; new-rich dealers in something—I forget what.”</p>

<p>The word “new” followed her about like a witch’s
curse. At Halsted it had been the last touch of praise
for everything. If you made a purchase, you called
everybody in the house to see it, whether it was a
diamond necklace or the tiling in the bathroom. But
in Gilthrotin nothing new was tolerated but necessaries
like bread and butter; diamonds were nothing accounted
of unless they had glittered first on a family
neck in a family portrait; and when progress and the
plumber forced you to a hot-water system or incandescents,
you were always glad that your great-grandfather
had not lived to see it. Under her cruel
consciousness of “newness” Dandy was oppressed
even to the earth. She frowned at the picture in the
glass, much as Hamer had frowned at soulless Halsted.</p>

<p>Few people had called, as yet, except the neighbouring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
clergy, together with countless daughters of the
horse-leech, cased in subscription-lists. More daughters
had written. Indeed, begging letters dropped like
hail. Hamer contributed to the first twenty-five,
and then sat down to think about the rest. The county
came slowly, however; in driblets, so to speak. Things
would alter in time, of course, for even in the conservative
country Hamer Shaw’s money would make its
way, as well as—later—Hamer Shaw’s sterling worth
and fine business capacity. And his daughter would
be taken up, when it was discovered that she hadn’t
actually worked in a mill and worn clogs, but was
merely a charming and well-educated member of
human society. But she would never be a queen
again, even then. She would never be even one of
the elect. She would always be “new.” In a ripe
old age she would have progressed no further than
“rather new.” She would always be an outsider at
Watters in Gilthrotin.</p>

<p>To do her justice, though she sent a sigh after her
lost crown, that was not the cause of her dissatisfaction.
For the first time in her smooth career she was arrested,
called to halt by something that thrilled almost to
pain. For the first time, too, she saw herself no
longer the pivot of her world, an outstanding figure
on an obliging background of earth, but a mere unnecessary
pigmy on its surface. She found the country
cruel and very lonely, full of shut secrets, fearful, yet
unquestionably alluring. In this new atmosphere,
where the true Romance still brushed by on velvet
wings, her unfledged soul shrank a little, and as yet
was lost. The name of it in books had stirred her to
a vague desire; the reality of it, keen as a sword,
rich as purple curtains before God, made her afraid.</p>

<p>The house affected her in the same way. Its
tranquillity, its dignity, its rapt air of hiding secrets
mystic as the Grail, impressed her as the attributes of
a living thing, with a mind and being larger than her
own. Its susceptibility, too, amazed her. Halsted,
for instance, had cared nothing for weather. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
the sun burned, you drew the blinds, and, within, the
luxury grew cool and fragrant; and when storm held
sway without, again the blinds were drawn, shutting
you into soft comfort, where electric light, silver, and
china, laughter and the click of balls or the slur of
dancing feet, struck always the same note of lapped
pleasure. But, at Watters, when the sun shone, the
old house stirred dreamily and smiled, and half-forgotten
pictured faces looked alive from the dim
walls, and threads of hot gold ran molten along the
dark floors. There was no need to curtain the sun;
the place needed it, and turned its old bones gratefully
under its touch. And on days of stress the house
shared it with the day; you could not shut the storm
from Watters. The wind was in the house itself,
lifting the rugs, whistling up the stair, crying like a
lost soul in the eaves. The hurrying sky was mirrored
in the glass of the panelling, and the beating rain
filled the stone eyes with streaming tears. Outside,
the full river swung above its banks, and the lost wail
of sheep on the mist-hung fell rode on the tortured
air.</p>

<p>But the silence was worse than anything, she found,—the
real silence that is full of notes but never a note
that jars. When she woke in the morning, it took
her by the throat. No jangling of trams, mill-whistles,
and trains; only, at times, faint music from the farm
across the way, and the slow, sleepy call of church-bells.
She could not lie, as she learned to do in later
days, staring with quiet eyes at the sky, wrapped in
a happy stillness more soothing than sleep. It often
woke her in the night—that full silence.</p>

<p>They had had visitors, at first. Before they were
fairly settled in the place, a crowd of friends had
descended on them, and Hamer Shaw would sooner
have shut his door to a Royal honour than an old
acquaintance. But the circle, so pleasant and suitable
at Halsted, was altogether out of the picture at Watters.
The very house itself would have nothing to say to
the guests; indeed, it deliberately sulked at them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
with grudging fires and lukewarm baths. It had
other tricks, too—sudden stairs down which they
tumbled in the dark; rattling windows, creaking
boards and whistling key-holes for the hag-ridden
hours of the night; soot in spotless grates, burst
pipes and skilfully situated coal-buckets; while the
outside world co-operated subtly, from the early
rooster to the midnight owl. These drawbacks had
been unknown at Halsted, and the guests asked each
other dismally what could have possessed old Hamer
to quit his palace for a God-forsaken monument like
Watters. Their torpedo-nosed cars had a kind of
abnormality in the little village at the river’s edge.
The Halsted habitués rent the night with gramophones,
and across the cool water flung the frenzied parlance
of snooker. They were Halstedites who had tangoed
through a dream in the lane. Dandy found herself
shrinking from them unintentionally but unmistakably.
She was glad when they went; and yet, when they
had gone, she was sorry, for she felt her place to be
with them. And the friends bemoaned themselves
as they motored home, saying sadly—“That’s the
end of <i>you</i>, Hamer, old man! In another year he’ll
have forgotten he ever knew us. It’s the country
does it—the benighted, besotted, be-swank-ridden
country. Give him six months more, and he’ll be
as rooted an old tree-stump as any of them!”</p>

<p>It wasn’t anybody’s fault, Dandy realised that
thankfully. The hosts had been kind as usual, the
guests hearty as ever, but the new conditions had
laughed the old friendships to scorn. It was very
sad, and it was also rather terrible, if you were once
fully convinced that a house, a senseless mixture of
stone and mortar, had done it all on its own!</p>

<p>Thus Dandy held review as she sat with her feet on
the rungs of the high stool. Later in the day, on
a sudden impulse, she unburdened her mind to her
parents.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be a bit hard for me,” she said
frankly, “so you must not be disappointed if I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
a failure! I don’t match here, and I’ve lost my old
element, so at present I’m neither flesh, fowl, nor good
red herring. I’ll have to grow to this place, and that
sort of thing takes time. I don’t mean that I’m unhappy;
it’s only that I don’t fit in. <i>You’re</i> all right,
aren’t you, mummy? You touched ground over the
Bluecaster butcher with the Halsted smile. And
father’s been all right all along. It doesn’t seem fair
that I should still be struggling in deep water.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Shaw said—“6 tr., 3 lacets, 1 sp., 31 tr.—have
you seen the new stair-rods?—4 sl. sts. from
third horizontal tr., turn!”</p>

<p>And Hamer took his pipe out of his mouth and
added—“It’s great!” and put it back again.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s great.” Dandy laughed and sighed.
“So great that I’m not sure I’ll ever get round to the
far side of it! It’s small and mean, too—does <i>every</i>body
keep a pet charity chained like a dog to nobble
new-comers? And those that don’t beg seem to be
tied up in a pride as big as a bath-towel—that nice,
cross agent-person, for instance, who looks rather like
a high-class keeper, and nabobs you off his land like
a reigning duke. <i>He</i>’ll never want to be kind to us,
I’m sure, and we must have <i>some</i>body to pass the time
of day with. Perhaps the house will decide. It
turned a cold enough shoulder on the poor Halstedites;
it owes us somebody in return. I hope it will send an
interesting selection soon, though it seems queer to
have to let a house choose your friends for you!
I get on fairly well with the villagers, though they’re
not exactly flattering. ‘Very pleased to meet you,
miss, I’m sure! You mind me something surprising
of her as was last school-teacher but two!’ That
was the ‘Jeanne’ frock, mother, that Wiggie used to
say looked like concrete moonshine, at Halsted. It
looks like the fairy queen in a ballet, <i>here</i>. Even my
sporting clothes are wrong—they sport too much.
And I find I don’t know any of the things that matter—when
the grass begins to grow, and which weather
is coming up from the sea, and what to call it when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
it <i>has</i> come. No, I don’t fit in. Perhaps I’ll learn,
after a while.”</p>

<p>Hamer Shaw said—“The land’ll teach you,” and
leaned back and shut his eyes. He could hear milk-pails
on the flags at the Parsonage Farm.</p>

<p>“And love,” Mrs. Shaw added, very unexpectedly,
“7 lacets, 7 tr., 9 ch., turn—don’t forget to look at the
rods!”</p>

<p>“The land—and love.” Dandy said no more,
knowing nothing of either. On the fell opposite a
floating wreath of mist was lifting delicately upward
like a lawn kerchief drawn from a sleeping face.
“The land—and love.” Great Masters. But the
land, as yet, would have none of her, and love might
never look her way. She could win the one if she
chose to woo it; the other and greater must come
unasked.</p>

<small>THE TROUBLE COMING.—THE GREEN GATES OF VISION:
II. MORNING</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Afraid</span> I’ve got to worry you a bit!” Bluecaster
began apologetically in his slow, shy voice. He was
big and broad-shouldered, with a manner toiling
anxiously to meet your approval, and never quite sure
of getting there. Yet there was the charm of breeding
in his diffident speech and pleasant smile, and under
all his patient horror of responsibility was a real desire
to do “the decent thing.” He looked at his agent
much as a conscientious hound looks at a kind and
skilful but strict whip. If you were fond of dogs,
you reached out your hand and patted him when
nobody was looking, and he licked your hand in return.</p>

<p>“You’ll wonder, I expect, why I never dropped
you a line to say I was coming, but, as a matter of fact,
I hadn’t meant turning up again just yet. Had to
leave the mixed doubles at Sledhammer. Ripping
tennis we were having, too—and yet they say we
landowners never do anything for our property!
But the fact is, I’ve been put out about something, and
I wanted to talk it over. How have things been going?
Any news?”</p>

<p>Lanty thought of the careful letters he had written
at such short intervals, detailed, explicit letters,
suggesting, accounting, and wondered how much, if
any, of the information had been grasped by his
employer. He did not refer to them, however, but
gave him the outstanding points of several situations
as simply and rapidly as possible. Bluecaster was
obviously glad when it was over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>The Ninekyrkes problem, though, had a chapter
to itself.</p>

<p>“That’s curious!” he said thoughtfully. “It
was about the land round there that I wanted to see
you. Nothing to do with the matrimonial mix-up, of
course! Very awkward for everybody, the girl
cutting up rough like that. I wonder they didn’t
call <i>you</i> in, Lancaster! They seem to think you can
settle most things.”</p>

<p>“Well, they did,” the agent confessed, “but I
wasn’t a success. I think I made matters worse, if
anything! There’s no other trouble, though, that I
know of, on the marsh. What have you heard, my
lord?”</p>

<p>Bluecaster, however, still beat about his particular
bush, inquiring after Helwise, the factotum, even the
Church Army Van. He always remembered Helwise
with little, quietly administered courtesies, though
she pestered him to martyrdom when he came within
reach.</p>

<p>“I’ve had a letter,” he broke out at last, with a
rush. “Yesterday—no, the day before. It’s from
a tenant, of course; though when I say of course, of
course I don’t mean of course, because they never do
write to me, at least, scarcely ever. They don’t need
to, when they’ve you.”</p>

<p>Lancaster wondered a little. A sense of coming ill
was in the air.</p>

<p>“They’ve a right to go straight to you, if they
choose,” he said, “though, as you say, they don’t
seem to find it necessary, as a rule.”</p>

<p>“Or much use, either!” Bluecaster smiled shamefacedly.
“You’re not so much older than I am, but
they wouldn’t give a brass farthing for my opinion
against yours. Neither would I, for the matter of
that! I don’t believe they ever remember that you’re
really a young man, yet. They come to you with all
their worries and woes, don’t they?—even the women!
You’re the real king of this little, ring-fenced pheasant-run.
I’m only a sort of Privy Seal that you carry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
about on your watch-chain. The tenants know that
as well as I do. Half the time they forget my existence,
but they believe in you like their prayers—all
except this blithering nuisance with his letter.”</p>

<p>“Nothing serious, I hope?” Lancaster was longing
for the point.</p>

<p>“Well—that’s just it. I don’t know. But <i>you’ll</i>
know, of course. That’s why I say it seems a bit
low-down writing me behind your back, so to speak.
Still, perhaps he thought it the right thing to do.
You see, it’s almost personal.”</p>

<p>“Personal?” Lanty smiled. “You needn’t be
worrying about my private character, if that’s the
trouble.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord, no!” Bluecaster almost blushed.
“Afraid I’m getting mixed and making an ass of
myself. But I think you’ll take this rather worse
than libel, if I’m not mistaken. Your father did so
much for the place. It’s seems such ghastly cheek,
calling any of his work in question.”</p>

<p>“Who’s the man, my lord? New, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course. At least, a new freak of an old
breed. The others would string themselves up before
they’d throw mud at a Lancaster. It’s Bracken
Holliday over at Thweng—little tin god in a Trilby
and a Studebaker-Flanders. Claimed me as a sort
of long-lost brother at Cunswick Races, and seemed to
think I was by way of being blessed of the gods in
having him on the estate. What made you let him
Thweng?”</p>

<p>“He’s old Holliday’s nephew—Willie of Pippin
Hall. Willie kept him as an orphaned lad until he
cleared out to Canada, and made money there, somehow.
He wrote to me from abroad about the farm,
and I thought he ought to have his chance. He’s not
framing over well, but I’m still hoping the old blood
will tell when he’s settled down, and that he’ll find
his level after a bit.”</p>

<p>“Not until he’s under the turf, I should say! Well,
it seems he’s got a down on the Lugg.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>Lancaster opened his eyes. The surface of his mind
scoffed, but in that instant the waiting trouble sprang
into existence. In every terrible memory there is
always one moment more poignantly lasting than the
rest. It is generally the moment when fear first
springs. All his life he remembered the tone in which
Bluecaster said—“The Lugg”—the plain, leather-upholstered
room and its harassed master. Yet he
scoffed. He answered with a smile.</p>

<p>“What’s he got against it? Not æsthetic enough
for him? Or has he some new patent facing that he
wants to palm off on us?”</p>

<p>“Nothing so mild.” Bluecaster lumbered through
all his pockets after a letter lying directly in front of
him. “It s the old story, of course. He says—where’s
the thing got to, anyhow?—that it isn’t safe.” He
pushed the envelope across, avoiding the agent’s eyes.
“He makes out some sort of a case—but you’ll see for
yourself.”</p>

<p>It was not an attractive letter, since courtesy had
been left in the lurch by an assurance very different
from the dignified independence of the men of the old
type. The writer had a good conceit of himself—you
could almost have deduced the Trilby and the
motor from the over-tall capitals—but in spite of the
insolent tone it carried a certain conviction that could
not be denied respect. He believed what he said
when he called the Lugg a public danger.</p>

<p>“Manners just a shade worse than mine, if anything!”
Bluecaster went on nervously. “His penny
a week seems to have gone shouting. Still, perhaps
we’d better let him down gently, as he’s so worried in
his mind. He’s nothing against the Let, of course,
but he’s got his knife pretty deep into the poor old
Lugg. I wonder what set him raising this view-hullo?
It’s in repair, I suppose, and all that kind of
thing?”</p>

<p>“I had it overhauled at the end of the bad weather.
It’s as good to-day as when my father built it.”</p>

<p>“That’s over fifteen years ago, isn’t it? How the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
county hummed!—remember? The Let was a pretty
piece of work, but the Lugg fetched ’em up all standing.
And what a rattling time the old lord had, sitting
round and watching while your father ran the thing!
He was getting a bit over age for Newmarket and all
that, and fighting the sea put him on finely for amusement.
People howled, and said it was defying Nature,
and so on. The papers kept an eye on it for years,
didn’t they? Remember that rough winter, when
a lot of them sent reporters down to be ready on the
spot when the bank broke, and the old serpent simply
laughed at them? Why, Lancaster’s Lugg made the
family famous! We’ve never done anything startling
on our own account—nothing publishable, anyhow.
And now this outsider has the old tale by the ears
once more. Give me the gist of what he writes, will
you?”</p>

<p>“He says—it opens well!—that nothing but the
most inflated arrogance would ever have built the
Lugg at all; that the land behind it is a death-trap,
while the Pride is a sheer insult in the face of the
Almighty. But that’s only the beginning. His main
argument is that the forcing of the tide into a narrower
channel is a distinct menace to the farms at the head
of the bay. (Thweng’s one of them, of course.) He
contends that each storm places them in imminent
danger, and demands that we break the bank, sacrifice
the new land, and give the flood room. (Just the
original arguments dug up again.) Failing this, he
promises us a tide held waiting in God’s Hand, which
will arrange matters so effectually that not only the
whole present world but all succeeding generations
shall gnash their teeth at us and brand us with shame!”</p>

<p>“It’s a bit rough, isn’t it?” Bluecaster put in
ruefully. “Seems pretty intimate Up Above, doesn’t
he? Of course, one isn’t such a Borgia as to want to
risk anybody’s life or set death-traps, or anything
such rotten bad form as that—I’d sooner let the sea
suck up the whole blessed income and have done with
it—but your father always said the new land would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
make money for us eventually, and the Lloyd-Georgian
era is very expensive. Surely he’s rambling
a bit, Lancaster?”</p>

<p>“He’s certainly quite unnecessarily anxious. I
can’t understand what has worked him to this pitch.
Sounds almost on the verge of brain-fever about it!
We had a few words when he took the farm—there
may be something of that at the back of it. Sneered
at our old-fashioned methods—we’ve scarcely any
agreements in writing, you know—and said <i>he</i> was
a business-man, anyway, and didn’t trust anybody.
Of course, after that, I had everything down with him
in black and white. This may be just his way of
trumping up a grudge on that account. He can’t
really consider the Lugg a danger, in spite of this
fervent epistle. It’s stood the test—both ways—for
so long. I’ve heard my father say that nothing short
of an earthquake wave could take the bank. I’ve
heard him swear that the head farms were as safe as
Heaven. He would never have risked a yard of the
land he loved. My father’s word is good enough
for me.”</p>

<p>“And for me!” Bluecaster added bluntly. “It
was a big undertaking, though,” he went on, with the
recurring nervousness in his voice. “I’d never have
had the pluck to broach it myself. The bay does look
a bit caught by the throat. I suppose it’s just possible
that a heavy flood with an exceptional gale behind
it—well, well, that’s all settled, isn’t it? What’s to
be done with this man? If he’s worrying, can’t he
change farms or something?”</p>

<p>“I hardly think he’ll do that.” Lancaster looked
again at the letter. “I can’t help feeling that there’s
something more that we’ll get at, presently. Of course,
as a marsh-tenant, he’s entitled to a hearing. He
might have put his views rather more delicately, but
that’s neither here nor there. Will you write him, or
shall I see him? And, if the latter, have you any
instructions?”</p>

<p>“Oh, see him, certainly!” Bluecaster looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
alarmed. “And of course you’ll know streets better
than I do what to say. As long as you think the
Lugg’s all right, it can’t be wrong. I’ll stop on a few
days, now I’m here, in case you want me, but you’ll
manage as you think best.” He heaved a sigh,
looking away. “I’m glad you’re sure about the old
bank! I thought it couldn’t be anything but a false
alarm, but one never knows. <i>You</i> do, though! A
Lancaster always knows. It’s a jolly good thing for
me I’ve a Lancaster to know for me!”</p>

<p>Lanty sighed, too, when he got outside, but it was
a little impatiently. Bluecaster was a splendid chap,
considerate, generous, reasonable even when he
couldn’t see the point, but he so often not only did
not see the point but made violent haste to escape it.
Difficulties that it was his special province to unravel
were transferred from his fingers to his agent’s with
the rapidity of cat’s-cradle. He was no support in
any problem; generally, indeed, an added factor to
the puzzle. In the growing atmosphere of trouble
Lancaster longed earnestly for his father.</p>

<p>On the gravel, a thought struck him, and he retraced
his steps. Bluecaster was playing billiards
by himself, and urged him to have a game. He
looked resigned but amiable when Lancaster reverted
to the tiresome subject he had thought happily
dropped.</p>

<p>“With your permission, my lord, we’ll have the
matter out with all the marsh-tenants. There may
be something more behind, as I said. Not but what
I’m sure they all trust the Lugg to a man, barring
Brack. Still, they shall have their chance of speaking,
if you’re willing.”</p>

<p>“Of course. Get ’em together when you like.
Need I be there?”</p>

<p>“I should prefer it. It isn’t a question for me to
handle alone. It wouldn’t be fair to ask me.”</p>

<p>That fetched Bluecaster at once, as he expected.</p>

<p>“Right you are! I’ll not shirk. I say—can’t you
really spare time for a hundred up?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>But Lanty couldn’t. He knew that his eye along
the cue would see nothing but the wriggling length of
the Lugg, and he got away again as soon as possible,
calling to the black spaniel that had waited on the
drive. He went out through the gardens and across
the park, half his mind busy with the new vexation,
the other turned, as usual, upon the general condition
of the property. Certainly, he had every reason to be
satisfied. The gardens were perfect. The old Tudor
house showed plainly enough that a keen eye watched
its every need. The park, too, had had its special
attention. The winding carriage-road was trim and
rolled; the fences were in order, the young trees
protected against cattle, and the Home Farm adjoining
was a model holding. Bluecaster was certainly very
well-groomed.</p>

<p>He climbed a hillock crowned by a ring of oaks,
from which he could see for miles in all directions,
and pride grew in him as he looked. Bluecaster
might have done nothing startling, as its owner had
said, might have sent no great statesmen or fighters to
its country’s service; but it was known throughout
the North for its prosperity, its careful management,
tempering justice with mercy. Bluecaster tenantry
were envied, for, if not pampered, they were always
considered, could always find an ear for a grievance.
Class-hatred was almost unknown on this particular
property, where so much of it ran into isolated dales
and along lonely marsh-borders. The balance between
landlord and tenant swung sanely and steadily, for
both had trust in the hand that held it. Only the
agent himself felt the weight of the scales cut deep.</p>

<p>But he had not failed. He had taken hold where
his father had loosed, and had kept his father’s
standard, stumbling at first, but steadying himself as
the years passed. He was squarely on his feet, now.
His back was straight. No. He had not failed.</p>

<p>He allowed himself this fleeting moment of satisfaction
and warm pleasure; and then the chill of the
new shadow crept over him, a cloud like a man’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
hand out of the west, where the marsh-farms lay. He
must think the matter out, have his words in order
before the tenants met. He turned his back on
Bluecaster, and sought his Lane of Vision.</p>

<p>The thunder had passed, and there was a bright
breeze flickering over the sun-touched fields like the
wind of a gaily-flirted fan. Even in the lane little
whiffs of it darted at him over the hedges, kissing
his cheek and brushing his lashes, and when he reached
the second arch, he saw it twinkling like the racing
feet of airy children over the new, green corn. But,
as under the brooding sky at Ninekyrkes, so here, in
the fresh morning, the foreknowledge of evil weighed
him down, and in his state of mental weariness, of
reaction from years of over-strain, he was too weak
to throw it off.</p>

<p>He had known that Bracken Holliday disliked him,
and would be glad to wound him if he got the chance.
Fresh home from the colonies, with money in his
pocket, Brack was a great man in his own estimation,
and if not perhaps quite on the same plane as Bluecaster
himself, felt at least a perfect equality with
the agent. Lanty had shown him plainly that the
feeling was all on one side, and Brack hadn’t forgotten
it. His acute mind had soon grasped that he could
hurt Lancaster quickest through his father, and the
fact that he had not had to forge his weapon, but had
found it sprung to his hand, had given it a strength
vastly superior to any carefully-invented grudge.
Lanty’s confidence stood firm, but his opponent’s
equal conviction hacked at his faith like a hedger’s
bill. Of course it would pass. The meeting would
laugh Brack to scorn, and that would be the end of
the matter. But for the first time a tenant had openly
and venomously questioned his father’s judgment and
his own, and it rankled. There rose in his heart the
cold anger waked by cruel criticism of our helpless dead.</p>

<p>He could see nothing but the corn through the
Second Gate of Vision, not even the towering Mountain,
though it had met him as he first stepped within.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>The break came under the hill, and over the timber
he could touch the land as it rose close, curved above,
and then raced away into the pale sky. The grain
had reached the moment when it waits the last fiery
kiss of the sun; it was still ungilt and tenderly green.
The crop was heavy, this year, rich as he had scarcely
ever known it. Standing beneath it, he could see how
thick it was down at the roots.</p>

<p>Just opposite the gap there was a break in the wheat
no more than half a yard wide, a miniature glade that
gambolled straight up into the air and vanished.
Lanty found himself wishing that he was just six
inches high, in a purple pansy coat, red pimpernel
boots and a pale primrose cap, so that he might strut
along that wonderful bridle-path, and hear what the
forest was saying on either hand. He had just decided
that the primrose brim should be edged with thistledown,
and carry a noble lamb’s-tail bravely dipping
down behind, when a lumbering, ebony body, eminently
unfairy-like, with lolling tongue and gleaming eyes,
crashed through his forest and down his glade, bringing
up heavy and panting at his very feet. Behind his
shoulder, Hamer Shaw and daughter besought the
fat Labrador to return to civilisation as typified by
the road. He raised his hat curtly. This girl and
her roystering belongings seemed destined to shatter
his most precious moments. She would think that
he was always gaping into vacancy like the village
idiot, leaning over a rotten gate. There seemed so
particularly little, too, to see just there, unless you
had the seeing eye. As before, he felt annoyed and
jarred.</p>

<p>The fat dog was too fat to squeeze, and much too
fat to jump, so, stooping wrathfully, he hauled it
into the lane, leaving the field much as if an elephant
had frisked through it. It greeted its owners with the
passionate relief of an explorer escaped from an African
bush. Lanty’s silky spaniel stayed decorously to heel.</p>

<p>Hamer had seen him at the sale, and introduced
himself, apologising for the Labrador’s behaviour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>“He isn’t used to things yet,” Dandy explained,
with a hand on the smooth head. “At Halsted—our
old home—he only had town-walks and motor-rides,
and behaved like an urban human being. Here,
he isn’t quite sure what he is, and he’s trying very hard
to find out. He’s not very strong in the upper storey,
and he can’t make up his mind whether he’s a retriever
or an otter-hound or only a ferret. I don’t know
what he thought he was, just now.”</p>

<p>“A reaper and binder, I should imagine!” Lanty
answered crossly, and then smiled in spite of himself,
conquered by the infectious cheerfulness of Hamer’s
laugh. “You’d better see and get him to heel as
soon as possible,” he added, severe again instantly,
“or you’ll be finding him behind a fence with a plug
of lead in him. The Gilthrotin keepers won’t stand
any nonsense, and he’d be difficult to miss.”</p>

<p>“You mean he’s too fat?” Dandy asked incredulously.
“Of course, he’s better fed than yours.”
She looked pityingly at the graceful spaniel, who
slapped a fluffy tail against the road, but did not stir.
“Grumphy has always had the same meals as ourselves.
We never leave him to cooks. Perhaps you
don’t care for dogs. Yours seems almost afraid to
move!” She hugged the Labrador, who leaned his
head against her and snored loudly, while the spaniel
slapped again in welcome to one who, if not quite
of the right figure, was nevertheless of the only correct
shade. “Grumphy doesn’t know what it is to hear
an unkind word!”</p>

<p>Hamer Shaw laughed again, this time at the helpless
disgust in Lancaster’s face.</p>

<p>“You think he’d be all the better for it, I expect?
Perhaps I agree with you, but he’s Dandy’s dog, you
see. My little girl knows nothing of country ways
yet, but she’ll learn. By the way, sir, they tell me
you’ve a lot to do with the fishing, here. I’ve had
some trouble over my private stretch of the river,
Can you spare me a minute or two?”</p>

<p>They fell into talk, and Dandy, excluded, wandered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
to the gap and stood looking at the joy-path of her
stout trespasser. Grumphy was a dear, but he was
certainly also a galumphing idiot. The agent-man
would think she was in the habit of taking her walks
with idiots. It was only the other day that her
variety-troupe had danced through his evening
meditation, and now her variety-dog had pranced
through his corn.</p>

<p>“It will straighten up in a day or two, with luck,”
he broke suddenly into her thoughts, looking with
her up the green aisle. “And if it doesn’t, there’s
not much harm done. You needn’t put too much
blame on your ten stone of dog.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean to blame him!” she flashed, colouring
a little. “Didn’t I tell you he was looking for
himself? I’m doing the same, if it comes to that.
<i>I</i> shall make mistakes, too. If I’m hard on him,
I shall have to be hard on myself.”</p>

<p>“You’ll both learn the quicker.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we’ve been spoilt—haven’t we, Grumphy
boy? We shouldn’t take kindly to the whip.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes the whip is the only teacher.”</p>

<p>He checked himself then, feeling that the intimacy
of the gap had misled him. He was in no mood to be
friendly, and departed presently with a curt good-bye.
Round the turn, he dropped his hand with a faint
snap of the fingers, and the spaniel, close at his knee,
thrust a gentle nose into his palm, looking up at him
with worshipping eyes.</p>

<p>“Starved, are you, old lady?” he asked, with
a shrug. “Neglected? Half-cowed? How would
you fancy yourself at the Royal, looking like that fat
Astrakhan or Saskatchewan or whatever they call it?
We’ll give him a bucketing some day over Ewrigg
after rabbits. Perhaps he’ll have settled what he is,
by that time, unless the keepers have settled <i>him</i>.”</p>

<p>He mentioned the meeting to Helwise, and asked
whether she had called yet. It seemed she had not.</p>

<p>“Of course one always <i>does</i> call at Watters, but it
isn’t the thing to rush. Five or six months is quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
soon enough for really <i>old</i> inhabitants. But I’ve been
meaning to go. I was only waiting until the balance-sheet
of the Kindness to Kitchenmaids came in.
They’ll be sure to give to that, because, if you don’t, it
looks as though you couldn’t afford a kitchenmaid,
like people who profess they adore walking when you
stop to offer them a lift. It was so difficult to find out
what they <i>were</i>—the Watters crowd, I mean. One
was afraid they might offer one tea in the kitchen—not
that one ever <i>does</i> get tea at a first call, but they
couldn’t be expected to know that. Still, I don’t
mind going, if you think I ought. There’s the Onion-Protesters,
too, and the Paper Roses.”</p>

<p>“They seem very decent people,” Lanty answered
shortly. “Not by any means savages, as you suggest.
I should be glad if you could find time to call, as I
have already met the daughter twice, but I shall be
extremely annoyed if you ask them for a penny at a
first visit.”</p>

<p>“But it’s my duty to get all I can for my societies,”
his aunt urged. “I do so despise people who take up
causes, and then forget all about them! Let me see—is
it <i>one</i> year’s subscription or two that I owe to the
Church Army? I suppose you could tell me if I
brought you my bank-book? And are you thinking
of going to the Roselands garden-party, to-day?”</p>

<p>Lanty said no; he had work on hand, and couldn’t
be taken from it; and Helwise thought how snappy
he had grown of late, taciturn at meals, and quick to
take all her statements awry. It was tiresome when
a man began to grow middle-aged and surly. She
congratulated herself upon being neither one nor the
other.</p>

<p>And Lanty thought of the morning’s problem, and
longed to speak of it, but did not. He would receive
more consolation from the shut lips of his father’s
portrait than from the mindless mouth of his aunt.
He could not tell her, but he fancied he could have told
Hamer Shaw. Hamer had captured him, even in their
brief meeting. He could picture himself laying the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
case before the big, sane mind, feeling his burden
lightened by the big, generous hand. But he knew
he would not speak; he had learned to keep silence
too long. He would see this through alone, as he
had seen many another anxious point. He went into
his office, and shut the door. Helwise spent the rest
of the day hunting up subscription-lists.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>NEW WINE IN OLD BOTTLES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next afternoon he ran into Harriet Knewstubb,
wheeling her bicycle into his front hall. She bestowed
upon him the kind of cool nod that you keep for the
butcher’s boy when you find him loitering at your
door without obvious excuse. She was a plain,
straight girl, with keen, dark eyes and a breeziness of
manner that made the air sing in your ears.</p>

<p>“Helwise asked me to call for her,” she announced—“explained”
implies a certain courtesy very aggressively
absent. “We’re going over to throw cards
at Watters. You’ve no objection to my shoving this
in here, have you? I hate my machine standing about
in the sun.”</p>

<p>Lanty said he was only too pleased, and watched
dispassionately while she scraped the doorpost with
her off-pedal, and a valuable oak chest with the front
mud-guard. Then he took it from her and put it in
a corner, inviting her to come in and wait, but she
refused.</p>

<p>“No, thanks. I’ll hang about till she’s ready.
Hope she won’t be long. We arranged to go early, so
as to skip kitchen tea. Is it true, do you know?
By the way, Helwise said something about driving.
Hope it isn’t a closed shanty, anyway! I can’t
stick them, myself. I told her she’d much better
cycle. Do her a lot more good than stuffing along in
an old ’bus.”</p>

<p>“It’s too hot for cycling.” Lanty tried not to look
annoyed. “You’ll hardly find it stuffy in the dog-cart,
I think. I prefer my aunt to drive. She’s so
energetic, I’m afraid of her knocking up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>In reality, he had shrunk from the mental image of
Helwise in flickering spots pounding through blazing
motor-dust to call at Watters. He had no feeling
for Dandy except irritation and misunderstanding,
but it would have hurt his pride that she should see
his only female relative sliding off a bicycle at her
front door. He had even gone to the unprecedented
length of suggesting costume, and Helwise, with a
conscience shrieking subscription-lists, had consented
to oblige. Miss Knewstubb, of course, was at liberty
to please herself, as far as he was concerned, and her
tastes were certainly plain. She could not be much
older than Dandy, he reflected, looking back over
years of acquaintance, but she gave no impression
of appealing youth. She bullied you at bridge,
hammered you at golf, while at tennis she picked you
up by the scruff of your neck, shook you, and slammed
you down again. These, however, were her amusements.
Her main business in life was farming Wild
Duck Hall, the pretty farm over the hill, and very
successfully she did it. He admitted that, even while
resenting her aggressive self-satisfaction, her pistol-shot
conversation and general hardness of appearance.</p>

<p>He knew vaguely that Dandy’s smart tweeds had
been too passionately sporting, the fringed tongues
of her polished brogues too elaborate, her little cap
worn at too rakish an angle, but she had kept a feminine
graciousness, nevertheless. Harriet’s skirt and shirt
were right for the place, if not exactly for a first call;
her smoothly-drawn tie was a tie and not a frivolous
butterfly of blue silk; her hat held no suggestion of
advertisement <i lang="fr">à la mode</i>; but she was hard from
her tall silk collar to the nails in her square shoes.
Even her glossy hair looked hard. He thought
gloomily that no man would ever want to put his lips
to it, or draw her well-set head against his shoulder.
Dandy’s hair was soft as gossamer. Her little head
would nestle as lightly as a downy Buff Orpington.
He shook off the wandering thought, surprised and
annoyed. She believed that he starved Flower!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>Helwise bustled down the stairs in the requested
lavender, and fell over the bicycle, which instantly
swung round by the head and described a graceful
curve on the paint with a ribbed handle. The master
of the house picked it up, and followed the ladies
out, to find them already mounted. Helwise was
anxious to be off, in case he remembered the subscriptions.
Harriet had dispossessed the factotum of
the reins, without asking anybody, and flourished
down the drive, leaving echoes of “kitchen tea”
behind her. Lanty went back into the house and
looked at the mark on the wall.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>They did have tea, after all, though not in the
kitchen. Hamer would have felt the evading of his
hospitality as a child the rejection of its penny bag
of sweets. He saw to it also that Armer had a square
meal. There were no half-measures about Hamer
Shaw.</p>

<p>He had a warm greeting for Lancaster’s aunt, and
laboured heartily through her mixed periods, while
Mrs. Shaw murmured crochet-patterns as she made the
tea, and Dandy, with an anxious expression, hearkened
to Harriet’s slashing opinions. There was a fair,
pale young man, sitting as close to her as possible,
who also seemed fascinated by the caller’s conversational
methods. Harriet was enjoying herself.</p>

<p>“Two and a half, <i>at least!</i>” she pronounced firmly,
with a critical eye on Dandy’s skirt. “Anything less
would be certain to trip you in turnips. And I don’t
recommend leather—no, I can’t say that I recommend
leather! It’s very nutty when it first comes home,
but give it a day over plough, and slap it has to go
into the bucket! Those brogues of yours are nailed
all wrong, too. They should be done in threes”—she
extended a foot for inspection—“and plain
tongues, of course, the plainer the better. Those
Indian-scalp imitations would soon hang you up in
a fence.”</p>

<p>“Does one run <i>all</i> day in the country?” the young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
man inquired, deeply interested. Harriet nodded
with condescension.</p>

<p>“One gets about. Of course there are crowds of
cat-footers who frowst indoors with a book or a needle,
but nobody worth mentioning. One’s always off
somewhere, either on a push-bike or Shanks’s pony.
The tennis is getting over, but I can put you up for
the hockey, if you care about it, Miss Shaw. I’m
captain, and Miss Lancaster is secretary and all that
kind of thing. By the way, Helwise, have you got
your fixtures out yet?”</p>

<p>Miss Lancaster turned a vague eye.</p>

<p>“Fixtures? I believe Lancelot has them somewhere.
He generally arranges them for me—I’m so
busy! He likes doing little things like that. Of
course, <i>I</i> do all the <i>real</i> work, shaking hands with the
teams when they come, and seeing that they have
plenty of hairpins and two cups of tea. <i>He</i> only
writes the letters and keeps the funds straight.”</p>

<p>“That’s her nephew,” Harriet kindly explained to
Dandy and the pale young man. “Agent for Bluecaster—perhaps
you’ve met him. Rather a slow old
tortoise, but well-meaning. So it’s settled you’ll
play hockey? Where’s your place, I wonder? Forward,
I should think, in a decent skirt.”</p>

<p>Dandy thanked her politely, having expressed no
opinion whatever on the matter. Hamer looked
across with a twinkle in his eye. Both Harriet and
Helwise pleased him mightily. The buffeting breeziness
of the one moved him to tolerant amusement,
while the silvery ineffectiveness of the other claimed
his chivalry. He promised subscriptions without
demur, and Helwise almost purred aloud. Lancelot
was so ridiculously narrow and proud. Why, these
new people <i>liked</i> to be asked!</p>

<p>“You’ll be going to the Show, of course?” Harriet
demanded. “Bluecaster Agricultural Show, I mean.
What do you do? Oh, you—you <i>prod</i>. Sheep and
cows and things, that is. I’m showing, of course,
and if I don’t get anything there’ll be a row. Perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
you know I farm? And you scrap with your friends
as to which hunter will grab the card—at least, other
people do. I’ve given it up myself, because I’m always
right. Occasionally I get a bit lost at the Royal,
and have to fall back on Lanty Lancaster, but I’m
always O.K. at these local arrangements. You’ll
join the choral society, I suppose? I’m nothing of
a singist personally, but I always put in an appearance.
They like it. Keeps the thing together, don’t you
know? I’m not sure that it’s quite good form to
have much of a voice—looks a bit like swank—so
you’ll be all right. Lanty Lancaster used to belong
at one time. He’s got a few decent notes somewhere
round the bottom C.”</p>

<p>“Wiggie—Mr. Wigmore—sings, too,” Dandy put
in meekly, glad of a chance to speak. The pale young
man was the only friend from the old life that had
managed to get into touch with the new. He had
stayed on unobtrusively after the others had departed
blatantly, and the house had not repudiated him.
Harriet gave him a casual stare.</p>

<p>“Oh?” she said, not at all encouragingly. “Not
platforms and things, I hope? We leave that to the
tradespeople, here. Evening-dress and a red handkerchief—<i>you</i>
know! Are you only stopping, or do
you belong? You might enter for my bumble-puppy
tournament, next Thursday.”</p>

<p>The pale young man looked regretful.</p>

<p>“I’d love to, but I shan’t be here, worse luck! I’ve got
to sing for a few people, that very day. I’m so sorry.”</p>

<p>“Platforms and things, I’m afraid!” Dandy added,
with a touch of mischief. “But a white handkerchief.
That’s something, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Harriet looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“But don’t you <i>do</i> anything?” she inquired briskly.
“What’s your handicap at golf? You look rather
like a bank. <i>Are</i> you a bank? Surely you do something
besides <i>sing</i>?”</p>

<p>Dandy opened her lips sharply, but Wiggie’s gentle
gaze crossed her own, checking her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>“I play draughts quite nicely,” he said thoughtfully;
and Harriet snorted and gave him her shoulder.
Dandy looked at the carpet.</p>

<p>“Well, I can rake <i>you</i> in, can’t I, Miss Shaw?
Two bob entrance, grub provided. Helwise, I’m
bringing Miss Shaw to practise on your pole! Mine’s
being painted for the tournament. If Lanty or the
scrape-up-behind man will play, we can have a
foursome.”</p>

<p>“Pleasure—of course—certainly!” Miss Lancaster
responded, dragged from a demand for rummage.
“Armer isn’t very safe, though. He <i>will</i> play a sort
of Aunt Sally, and it hurts. And Lancelot is very
worried, just now. Some of his silly tenant-people
are leaving, and he’s quite put out about it. You’d
think he actually <i>cared</i> when an old man began to
fail, or his children turned out badly! I tell him they
all look exactly alike to me, so I’m afraid I can t
pretend to be very sympathetic.”</p>

<p>“You mean the Ninekyrkes business?” Harriet
asked. “It’s all over the place, of course, about young
Whinnerah and Michael’s daughter. The girl’s been
over-educated, that’s what’s wrong. Thinks herself
too good for her own class. They sent for Lanty,
didn’t they, to try and patch things up?”</p>

<p>“Why, does he always lend a hand in the tenants’
love-affairs?” Hamer laughed. “That’s a big order,
surely!”</p>

<p>“Oh, they use him as a family iron to smooth out
the creases!” Helwise sighed. “I have no doubt
he talked to the girl like a Methuselah. He has no
<i lang="fr">joie de vivre</i>. People with no <i lang="fr">joie de vivre</i> are very
depressing to live with. Oh, <i>thank</i> you, dear Mr.
Shaw! That will be a guinea each for the Protesters
and the Rummage, half a guinea for the Paper Roses—it
<i>was</i> the Paper Roses, wasn’t it?—and, by the
way, did I mention the Torn Tea-Cloths? Oh,
you must really allow me to interest you in the Torn
Tea-Cloths!”</p>

<p>She had the money in her hand when Lanty was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
suddenly announced, and Hamer, following his accusing
eyes, grasped the situation instantly.</p>

<p>“I’ve just been getting Miss Lancaster’s opinion
on your local charities,” he remarked, putting his
big, kindly person between the two. “I’m a whale
at charities—you just ask our Dandy Anne! They’re
a sort of hobby of mine, and I’m glad to have a bit
of advice from somebody who knows what’s worth
helping. Mother, give Miss Lancaster another cup
of tea!”</p>

<p>“Hamer doesn’t count life worth living if he hasn’t
a hand in somebody’s pie,” his wife added, comfortably
following on. “There was one whole year I declare
he talked of nothing but overworked tram-horses!
I’m glad to see you, Mr. Lancaster! You know
Dandy there, I fancy? That’s Mr. Wigmore, an old
friend of ours from our old home.”</p>

<p>Lanty found himself engineered to a chair beside the
daughter of the house, while his aunt hurried clinking
coins into her purse behind Hamer’s broad back.</p>

<p>“You needn’t scowl at old Helwise like that!”
Harriet flung at him, brutally undoing the family
diplomacy in a breath. “Why shouldn’t she go round
catching pennies if she wants? It’s no business of
yours!”</p>

<p>Lanty looked at her seethingly, the memory of the
bicycle handle still rankling, but before he could
answer, Wiggie was at his elbow with a teacup. He
remembered him now as the singer in the Lane, and
a further memory, of much older standing, fretted
vainly at the back of his brain. A moment later he
heard him telling Helwise that he had found half a
sovereign in the gutter, and couldn’t in conscience
spend it on himself. The gentle voice was so convincing,
the purring answer so ecstatic, that he smiled
unwillingly, meeting deprecating flower-blue eyes at
his side.</p>

<p>“It seems so rotten to rook you at a first call!”
he broke out. “I expect you’ve come up against
a fearful lot of that sort of thing already, and it can’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
impress you very favourably. That’s the worst of
the country. Everybody has some sort of a show
wanting a leg-up, and all the giving falls on the same
people. You’ve got to help, even when you’re not
interested, or half the things would never run at all.
But new-comers should have a certain amount of
rope. You must stand out when it gets to rank
robbery, and ask for time!”</p>

<p>“We’ll consult Watters!” Dandy said promptly.
“This is a very strong-minded house—did you know?
We have to give in to it dreadfully. It was simply
hateful to our Halsted friends, especially the Tango
ones—<i>you</i> didn’t like them either, did you?—and now
it has taken a dislike to the gardener we brought with
us—drops slates on him in a dead calm, smokes him
out of the potting-shed, and, if he tries to put up a
ladder, simply humps its back and throws it off again!
I’m afraid he’ll have to go. It’s bearing <i>us</i>, so far,
but of course we’re very careful. Mother wanted to
turn the old nursery into a linen-room, but the minute
she suggested it a patch of damp appeared on the
ceiling, though there hadn’t been any rain for weeks;
so we had to give up the idea. It likes Wiggie tremendously,
though. His bathwater is always hot, and his
room’s always full of spiders, and stacks of little
sunbeams follow him everywhere, patting him on the
head.”</p>

<p>Lanty laughed, and she felt quite disproportionately
pleased. When he laughed, he looked years younger
and a hundred times less worried. Then Harriet
plunged into the lightened atmosphere with the
pawing of a battle-horse.</p>

<p>“I say—what about this matrimonial agency of
yours? We’ve all been hearing about Francey
Dockeray and young Lup. What did you say to the
girl, and how did she take it?”</p>

<p>The transient boyish look left his face. Dandy had
drawn him into a quaint little world where tenants
and their troubles had no place, but Harriet hauled
him out again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>“Aren’t you asking a bit too much?” he answered
as amiably as he could. “You’re a Bluecaster
tenant, too, remember! You’ll like <i>your</i> sermon kept
private, I fancy, if ever I come arbitrating in <i>your</i>
love-affairs!”</p>

<p>It was said merely to chill her curiosity, but its
actual effect was quite unaccountable. Harriet blushed—a
slow, surprising blush from the rigid silk collar
to the smooth hair—but she met his eye with fierce
contempt in spite of it.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, be an oyster, if you choose! <i>I</i> shan’t
die of it! You didn’t do much good, from all accounts.
Have you seen Brack Holliday, lately? They say
he’s raking up the old fuss about the Lugg.”</p>

<p>The foreboding slid in and tapped him on the
shoulder. He had not meant to come to Watters, but
something had driven him; perhaps the same need
of Hamer Shaw’s strength that he had realised
yesterday. He had left the worry at Hamer’s door.
Things were no different, he told himself. The Lugg
held no threat. Brack had no case. But after that
one bright moment of clear-eyed proportion, Harriet
had whistled the fear back to his side.</p>

<p>“Brack’s teeming with theories—has his pockets
full of them!” he answered abruptly, getting up.
He moved across to his hostess, excusing himself on
business grounds. Helwise gathered herself together
in a flutter and dropped her open purse, standing
helpless in chattering dismay while everybody else
dived and darted after trundling coins. Lanty took
a last look round the room, while Wiggie, grave and
anxious, moved the coalbox and the fender and the
fire-screen and all the fire-irons to rescue a threepenny-bit.
It was a lovely room, and it soothed him; it
made his own still more absurdly desolate and drear;
but even this was not his ideal. Somewhere, dimly
defined in his imagination, was his holy place, with
time-worn furniture and the calling atmosphere of
home.</p>

<p>“Queer little body!” Hamer observed when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
had seen Helwise and her purse safely off the horizon.
“Talks like a string of telephone-wires touching in
a wind. And the young one sounds as though she
was pillow-fighting folk all the time! But they’re
both ladies—queer how it creeps out, in spite of
the top dressing! And the lad’s a gentleman too,
although he’s so short and see-you-damned-first! He’s
worrying, though, more than a bit. Seems to me he’s
got something on his mind. Didn’t he strike you that
way, Dandy Anne—as if he’d something on his
mind?”</p>

<p>“He isn’t happy,” Dandy answered slowly. “He’s
always thinking you’re going to hurt him, and getting
ready for it. People don’t do that when they’re
happy.”</p>

<p>“Likely he’s got too much to carry,” Hamer said
thoughtfully. “He’s bitten off a big bite in Bluecaster,
and they say the young lord don’t help much
with the chewing. Some writing-chap has it that the
strongest man is the one that can walk under the
heaviest weight without staggering, but he doesn’t
say how soon he drops in his tracks. I’ve a feeling
that that Bluecaster agent isn’t so far from dropping.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Shaw laid a hand on his arm and drew him
towards the door. Wiggie had petitioned her with a
glance.</p>

<p>“Now, Father dear, you leave that particular tram
alone! The horse may be a bit overwilling, but it
doesn’t follow it isn’t up to weight. Don’t start
putting things right before you’ve found the hitch.
Come and help me unpack the new vacuum cleaner.”</p>

<p>“I hate to see any creature overpressed,” Hamer
said pitifully. “I know what it is—it eats the soul
out of you if you haven’t some big happiness behind
to hold you up. And he hasn’t that. I can see he
doesn’t take kindly to that little aunt of his. I
should say they don’t pull well together. He’s lonely,
is that young chap; he’s not satisfied—right you are,
Mother, I’m coming!”</p>

<p>Wiggie had got his wish—Dandy all to himself—but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
he did not say anything for quite a long time.
Instead, he came as if by accident to the piano, and
though he played nothing coherent, he drew out
funny little bunches and ripples of sound that somehow
made the cool room seem cooler. Now and again he
glanced at Dandy, sitting on her favourite stool with
her head bent. She was changed already, he thought,
and she was only too obviously not thinking of him.
She had lost a little of her Halsted brilliance; she was
a shade thinner, a shade dimmed, as if some new
power had breathed a moment on her soul. Wiggie
turned his eyes away when he thought that. His own
soul was full of delicate little instincts like the dainty
grace-notes tripping under his touch.</p>

<p>Dandy was thinking of Lancaster, and wondering
why she had felt pleased when he laughed. Was it
because in that instant he had ceased to be aloof?
Yet how alien he really found her! There was the
whole network of outlook between them. More than
anybody else he had made her feel “new.”</p>

<p>Wiggie stopped playing bunches and began to whisper
a desperate French appeal—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first" lang="fr">“Ma chandelle est morte,</div>
<div class="verse" lang="fr">Je n’ai plus de feu:</div>
<div class="verse" lang="fr">Ouvre-moi la porte,</div>
<div class="verse" lang="fr">Pour l’amour de Dieu!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Dandy said “Don’t!” quite suddenly, without in
the least meaning to, and, without in the least meaning
to, he got up and came to her.</p>

<p>“Are you hankering to help the tram-horse, too?”
he asked, and she lifted her eyes with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Nothing so unselfish, Wiggie dear! But that
song always makes me shiver. The door is so fast
and so hard. It is bolted and barred, with iron knobs
as big as mushrooms, and nothing gets under it but
the draught of one’s sighing.”</p>

<p>“<i>My</i> door isn’t like that!” Wiggie said quickly.
“It’s as fine as thistledown and as thin as air, but it
keeps you out all the same. You can see through it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
all the dearness within, but—it keeps you out! If it
were hard, you could hammer the ache out of your
heart, and lay your cheek against the mushroom knobs
for pity. But you cannot bruise your fists on gossamer,
and the web of it blows weakly pitiless against your
cheek.”</p>

<p>“But it’s not for you to hammer at doors,” he
added presently. “They fly open all along your
road!”</p>

<p>She shook her head doubtfully.</p>

<p>“I’ve a feeling I may come to it before I’m through!”
she said whimsically. “I can see myself in the dust
and the dark, hugging a dead candle, and begging,
begging——”</p>

<p>He stopped her with a gesture.</p>

<p>“Don’t cheapen yourself! Don’t stand at the door
like the milk. The golden drink should be kept for
the golden chalice.”</p>

<p>“Why, Wiggie, what snobbish butlerage! It is
the stone jar that makes the beauty of the miracle.
Watters has taught me that.”</p>

<p>He took her hands.</p>

<p>“But for me even Cherith’s brook is dried up,—Dandy
dear?”</p>

<p>Her lips quivered.</p>

<p>“Don’t quote Elijah into my mouth, Cyril!”</p>

<p>He let her fingers slip,—not abruptly, but with a
lingering touch that left no sense of desolation.</p>

<p>“Forgive me! When one is thirsty, even the golden
wine is not too precious and wonderful to drink. It’s
all right. I didn’t mean to worry. Go on thinking
about the tram-horse.”</p>

<p>He went back to the piano and played more bunches.
Presently he asked to be taken to see the vacuum cleaner.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>THE UPPER AND THE NETHER STONES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> marsh-meeting was held at Pippin Hall, the
principal farm at the head of the bay, standing boldly
on the edge of the sand and looking strictly out to
sea. From it the Lugg could be seen in all its length,
and the full sweep of the tide running between the
narrow shores. Willie Holliday held Pippin with his
two sons, and for all that they had harboured him as
a child, they hadn’t a good word among them for
Cousin Brack of Thweng. Brack was always finding
mares’ nests and raising alarms, and generally trying
to teach his grandmother. It was just like Brack’s
cheek to think he knew better than a couple of
Lancasters and the whole of the marsh-men put
together!</p>

<p>A quiet little tide was washing under the Let as
Lanty drew rein at the farmyard gate. In the
blurred distance the back of the Lugg rose from the
gently-heaving water like some zoological monster
wading happily in a tank. It had a drowsy air of
good nature and content as the passing wavelets
slapped its side. There was no hint anywhere of
tragedy or fear. He had taken the matter far too
seriously. Probably the farmers thought him a fool
for calling the meeting at all.</p>

<p>Certainly, the group in the yard was treating the
affair as a huge joke. Men were asking Will Holliday
whether he did daily boat-drill with his stock, and there
was much laughter when the local wit, Thomas
Dennison of Lockholme, produced a life-belt, borrowed
from the old Ship Inn, and proceeded solemnly to
try it on everybody in turn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>Bluecaster was there already. Lanty could see the
black liveries in front of the door. Bluecaster himself,
in shabby riding-kit and any sort of a hat, was bravely
trying to dispense exactly the same amount of attention
to each tenant in turn, and chuckling appreciatively
at the trenchant wit of the older men. Yet he did not
find the life-belt quite as funny as the rest, Lancaster
noticed with surprise. He had had one or two narrow
shaves out yachting, and was recounting them with
some earnestness when he caught sight of his agent,
and came to meet him with a touch of confusion.
Lanty wondered a little as he handed Blacker to Willie’s
younger son.</p>

<p>There was about a dozen of them all told, including
Wolf and Michael from over the sand. Only Brack
was missing, and even as they realised it they heard his
car on the flat road, and, a minute later, sitting low in
his seat, with his hat on one side and a cigarette
at the corner of his mouth, he swung gracefully round
the stoup. It was a very effective entrance—the
pretty curve, the easy pull-up at exactly the right
point, the nod and the casual eyelids dropped in
general greeting, the flicking of ash with a ringed finger
over the glossy door—thoroughly well-staged in every
detail. It was a pity that the most important person
present should have chosen that particular moment
for addressing a miserable barn-cat. Bluecaster had
his own methods of conveying his opinions, and he was
certainly fronting the right way a minute after, when
Denny, carrying the belt like a floral funeral-offering,
deposited it mournfully upon Brack’s bonnet. Brack’s
temper was slightly on edge as he slid out of the car
and stamped on the cigarette.</p>

<p>He was a slim, dark young man, of the type glorified
in tailors’ windows, and his neat suit and grey spats
carried a suggestion of being still behind plate-glass.
He would have been an ordinary person of rather
vivid good looks but for his arresting eyes—of a clear,
cold gray, with the pupils very black and steady.</p>

<p>He lifted his hat to Bluecaster where his uncle had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
lifted a finger. Bluecaster acknowledged gravely.
To Lanty he nodded. Lancaster—there is a whole
code in the action—nodded back. After which they
trooped into the house.</p>

<p>Even there, though, settled round the kitchen table,
with his lordship at one end and the agent at the other,
there was a frivolous tendency to regard the meeting
more as a friendly “crack” than a call to business.
It was some time before Bluecaster, at last allowing
Brack’s deeply-chagrined countenance to swim gently
into his ken, hammered on the table for silence.
Then he got to his feet diffidently, stammering and
sticking a little, his glance travelling nervously from
face to face. He had Will Holliday on his right hand,
and Dockeray on his left, with Bownass of Moss End
beyond, Bradley of Wilson Fold and old Simon
Farrer of Meadow’s Ing. They looked at each other
stolidly, and said “Ay, ay! Yon’s reet!” at intervals.</p>

<p>Brack was about the middle, with Wolf on one side
and a joyful Holliday cousin ready with gibes on the
other. Denny sat directly across, and pretended to
be rowing hard whenever he thought Bluecaster
wasn’t looking. Brack stared over him and through
him, and hated the whole lot of them, lock, stock and
barrel. It was a pity they were too stuck in the mud
to recognise real merit when they ran into it head
first.</p>

<p>Lanty listened to Bluecaster’s speech with the faint
discomfort that he always experienced under his
employer’s efforts. In the landlord’s place, and in his
own present grim mood, he would have told the lot
of them to stay and be drowned or clear out and be
damned, but that wasn’t Bluecaster’s way at all.
On the contrary, he was always pathetically anxious to
carry a stray leg of anybody’s donkey.</p>

<p>A question had been raised about the Lugg, he told
them—was it really as safe as was made out? There
was an old theory just brought up again that in flood-time
the tide hadn’t enough room. Well, it always
<i>had</i> had enough room, they knew that, but of course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
nobody could answer for the future. The question
was—were they justified in continuing to gamble on
the point? The late Mr. Lancaster, whom they had
all known, and not only known but respected, had given
as his definite opinion that there was no gamble in
the matter at all. World-famous engineers had, after
the first, backed that opinion, and so far the Lugg
had proved them all right. Mr. Lancaster had
affirmed that it was no sort of danger to the east side,
while it meant a great benefit to the north. Speaking
as a landowner, he was naturally anxious to see the
estate improved and extended, but, speaking as a
man, he was not willing to risk, even upon a mere
possibility, good tenants who were also, he hoped,
his very good friends. If the Lugg was really a
danger, it must go, but he felt sure that wouldn’t be
necessary. He would now call upon Mr. Bracken
Holliday of Thweng to put before them his views on
the matter.</p>

<p>Brack was only too ready to be up, in spite of
cousinly adjurations to “Hod thy gab, an’ let yan o’
t’aald yans kick off!” Denny was now swimming
violently behind Bradley’s back, but Brack ignored
him, fixing his eyes on Bluecaster. He was nervous
at first—the antagonism in the atmosphere had the
passivity but also the resistance of the yard wall—but
it ceased to embarrass him as he warmed to his
subject. His pace quickened, his words came easily.
For the moment he forgot any petty personal animosity,
and the sincerity of his belief wrung attention even
from the most scathing mocker.</p>

<p>He knew he was a stranger, nowadays, he said,
and what had been good enough for them for so long
was sure good enough for him. That was one way of
looking at it, no doubt. But—now he didn’t want
to put on frills!—he’d knocked about the world
more than a bit, and he’d seen little jokes played by
Nature that here on the marsh they’d just laugh down
and out if he was fool enough to waste time telling
them. But they had set his mind’s eye jumping, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
it was still jumping when he settled down at Thweng.
At first he had been content to take the word of older
men than himself, but after a while that mind’s eye
of his got jumping again, and told him right out that
the Lugg had got the cinch on the top marsh-farms.
No, he didn’t believe they were safe! He had a
slap-up, cracker-jack reason for refusing to believe
it, but he meant to keep it to himself, along with the
jokes in meteorology. They had no guarantee, except
an almighty run of luck, (that was probably pretty well
run out, by now), that the Lugg wasn’t throttling the
bay. They had never had a real storm to test it, not
one of those storms that could buck the roof off
creation. The Lugg had never seen the real goods.
There had been an imitation, fifty or sixty years back—his
uncle would remember it—when the marsh roads
were under water for a week. There was no Let
then, certainly, but he opined the Let wouldn’t have
made much difference, and anyway the flood had had
full room. That wasn’t the case, now. They had
no guarantee—he struck one hand against the other
and the cousin copied him, while Denny swam harder
than ever—he didn’t mind repeating it, because it
was the thing he wanted to hammer plum into their
minds—<i>they had no guarantee that the Lugg wasn’t
throttling the bay</i>! It wasn’t as if the tides were
backing off. He guessed it was the other way about.
From what he could remember before he went West,
the force of the inflow was greater now than it had
been then. He wasn’t setting out to say it was much,
but the mere fact itself meant a lot. He called upon
his uncle to say how close on Pippin walls the last winter
tides had brought the sea.</p>

<p>Avuncular love failed him, however, for Willie,
disgusted at being thus dragged in without notice,
was understood to reply that he wasn’t “in t’dock or
any sic-like spot,” and Brack had to fall back once
more upon his own unsupported eloquence.</p>

<p>It wasn’t as if the Lugg protected the north farms.
It hadn’t even that excuse. Ninekyrkes and Ladyford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
were safe enough, W.P. and G.W., with the Let to
guard them. But all the Lugg protected was land
clean robbed from the sea, while it threatened other
land that the sea had given them of its own accord.
So far, the sea hadn’t fired them out, but it would
do it some day. He was dead sure the estate was
crowding its luck! As tenant of a marsh-farm,
sharing what he reckoned a very real danger, he asked
his lordship right now to give the matter his earnest
attention.</p>

<p>He sat down abruptly, and the cousin patted him
violently on the back, disarranging the set of his coat.
There was a pause, during which everybody looked at
the agent, and after a glance at Bluecaster he slowly
obeyed the unspoken call.</p>

<p>Brack’s virulent letter in mind, he had been surprised
by the temperate tone of his speech. Perhaps
he was reserving his private knowledge of the
Almighty’s intentions for a peroration to be appended
later. But thus far he was behaving well enough,
and deserved a temperate reply.</p>

<p>They all knew that marsh-farms had their drawbacks,
he said plainly. The land had belonged to the
sea once. There was always a remote chance that the
sea might claim it again. In this case he was prepared
to say that it was very remote indeed. The farms
were certainly not death-traps, as had been very largely
suggested, and he was quite unable to see why the
Lugg, after a trial of over fifteen years, should not be
allowed to continue its existence. There was a big
stretch of land behind it, which might one day be
very valuable. It ought not to be sacrificed in a
moment’s panic. His father had taken great pride
in the sea-walls, particularly in the Lugg, and, as his
son, he was naturally averse to hearing its reliability
questioned; but if any real evidence could be brought
against it he need not say he should be the first to
listen. He did not consider, however, that it had
been brought as yet. The increase of pressure also
he took leave to doubt. In fact, he was ready to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
maintain that the danger referred to was practically
non-existent, but he would be glad to hear what the
older men had to say, men who had known his father,
and the Lugg when it was first framed.</p>

<p>Holliday was still upset at being treated as a witness
for the prosecution, and couldn’t be got to speak, and
Bownass and Bradley started to rise at the same
moment, and fell back, glowering at each other.
Finally, Wolf stirred, taking his time about getting
to his feet, and leaning heavily on his stick as he
looked round the table. There was curious weight
in his slow gaze, curious strength in his slow speech.</p>

<p>“There’s them as is born to <i>do</i> things,” he began
deliberately, “an’ them as is born to find fault!
I knew Mr. Lancaster’s father a sight o’ years, and he
was always a-doing, and it was always the right things
he did. He was a grand man, the grandest man I
ever clapped eyes on! His word was his bond. If
you’d his word, there was no call for inkhorn-stuff
and such-like—nay, nor a postage-stamp ontilt,
neither!” (He looked at Brack, and a smile went
pleasantly round.) “He was a just man. He had
fair treatment for everybody. There’s folks, likely,
as think he favoured me, being over at our place a
deal, seeing to the Lugg, but they can just put this
in their pipes and smoke it. There was a year after
I first took hold as Mr. Lancaster give me notice to
quit—said I wasn’t doing well by the farm, and
wouldn’t take telling. Ay, and he was right an’ all!
I was young and a bit above myself, I reckon, but
that fetched me up sharp. The missis begged us on
again with a deal o’ trouble, and I never looked back
after. I’d learned my lesson. Ay, he was a just
man!</p>

<p>“And he was a good man. If a farmer got behind,
he knew he could go to Mr. Lancaster for help; and
if he meant fair an’ square, he’d <i>be</i> helped, right enough.
And we all know he was a man wi’ <i>brains</i>. There’s
proof on every mile of the estate. He could see twice
as far ahead as most folk, and twice an’ a half farther<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
round. Bluecaster knows best what it owes him,
though there was always a-plenty folks in his road,
same as there was with the Lugg. An’ now, just look
ye here a minute! Would a just man favour one bit
of land over another? Would a good man let traps
to folk as trusted him? And would a clever man—a
man o’ <i>business</i>”—this went home quickest, and
he knew it—“risk good farms for a bit of a show-off?
Mr. Lancaster give us his word the Lugg would do us
no harm, and his word has a fifteen years’ stamp to
it as never come out of no government office. There’s
young Mr. Lancaster saying the same, an’ that’s all
there is about it. I tell you what it is again—there’s
them as <i>does</i> things, an’ them as finds fault. It’s
easy choosing, I reckon, for folk as has eyes in their
head and a bit o’ good hoss-sense!”</p>

<p>The funny little gruff salvos of applause that had
punctuated this speech ended in a regular fusillade
of commendation. Lanty said “Thanks, Wolf!”
quite simply, and looked round for the next speaker.
There were two or three ready by now, and they said
much the same as Wolf, though they did not handle
Brack quite so delicately. Brack had a rare lot of
names pinned to his jacket before they were through,
and had to sit passive while the conservative farmers
followed the track like so many sheep. He was aching
to be up again, and had difficulty in restraining himself
when Denny, having anxiously awaited his turn,
plunged into public speaking.</p>

<p>Denny thought it was time somebody cracked a bit
about the present Mr. Lancaster. He himself was
a younger man who hadn’t farmed under the former
agent, but at least he could say he wasn’t wanting
any better sort than he’d got! If the present Mr.
Lancaster said the Lugg was all right, that was full
stop and a lick for Thomas Cuthbert Dennison. As
for the duke who was shaping to farm Thweng in
a Trilby, he’d likely hit upon a thing or two he didn’t
know if he lived long enough and looked hard. Even
he, Denny, could happen learn him a bit about sowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
corn an’ such-like, and there was more than one of
them on the spot who could give him a leg-up over
pigs. There was a roar at this, for Brack had a patent
drill that sowed each seed separately—so separately
that, when the grain came up, you could walk between
the stems; and there was also a tale that he had given
his pigs water used for boiling hams, with horrible
results. Even Bluecaster’s presence could not restrain
the general joy, and there was not much of Brack’s
moderation left when he rose to his final effort.</p>

<p>“You’ve only one argument in your whole outfit!”
he raged at them bitterly, “and that’s the old, threadbare
wheeze that because your fathers did a thing
you’re bound to follow their trail. It makes me tired
to see the lot of you—narrow, ignorant stick-in-the-ditchers—sitting
round with your mouths and ears
open for any old thing a Lancaster may choose to
pour in! You’ve got that durned Lugg fixed in your
minds as a kind of monument to your late agent.
Well, I guess you’re right in one way. It <i>is</i> a monument,
sure—a monument to the biggest piece of swank,
the rankest self-conceit I ever struck! Look at the
Pride! You’ll say it’s as safe as Bytham Knott, and
yet there’s nobody will live in it. They try, but they
can’t stand it out—and why? Because they know
the man that built it laughed in the Face of God!
You say he was a good man, a just man, but <i>I</i> say he
was a theatrical guy, with an eye on the gallery and
swank fit to jump the earth! I tell you I’ve my own
reasons for knowing what’s coming—coming on the
hop—and there’s somebody sure going to get left.
Right now’s the time to pull out, if you’d only listen!
But you won’t. You’re too deep in your dusty old
beliefs for that. But you’ll listen, you may bet your
life, and <i>remember</i>, in the night when the sea comes
knocking at your door!”</p>

<p>There had been silence through his speech, the
silence of outrage, and there was still silence when he
stopped. His strange eyes looked singularly bright
and compelling. Lanty stared curiously at him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
during the pause, and followed his glance, the men
round him doing the same. Brack was looking at
Bluecaster.</p>

<p>To a very timid, sensitive nature there is, in the
forcing of a decision, something of the inhuman terror
of being hunted down. The young man was between
two fires. If he stood by the Lugg, he carried the
lives of men. If he stood by Brack, the Lancasters
went to the wall. The first responsibility had been
another’s; this was his. Brack was thrusting it upon
him with keen eyes that held and coerced him and
would not let him go.</p>

<p>“His lordship agrees with me!” the latter cried
suddenly, so sharply that more than one man jumped.
“His lordship is on my side—sure! Ask him if his
conscience isn’t hustling him! Ask him what he
thinks away down in his heart of Lancaster’s Lugg!”</p>

<p>Bluecaster moved in his chair and opened his lips.
There was breeding in the way he mastered his inward
shrinking, and tried to smooth the warring elements
into courtesy.</p>

<p>“You are making things a little difficult, Mr.
Holliday!” he said gently. “Won’t you sit down and
allow us to finish the discussion quietly? You will
gain nothing by vilifying an honourable gentleman
whom all here remember with affection and regret.”</p>

<p>“I’ll sit down when I’m through!” Brack said
insolently. “I’m asking your lordship for a straight
answer. Are you on my side or are you not?”</p>

<p>Bluecaster looked down the table. There was no
staving it off. He must act if he could get no other
to act for him. In his extremity he did what he
had always done—dropped his burden for Lanty to
pick up.</p>

<p>“I am on the Lancasters’ side always,” he answered
Brack. “You have produced no conclusive arguments,
and naturally I put their word before yours. If
Mr. Lancaster thinks the Lugg should stand, I think
so, too. That is all I have to say.”</p>

<p>It was cowardice, and it sounded like courtesy—flight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
and fear, though it seemed like standing shoulder
to shoulder; and only two men present guessed it
for what it was. Bluecaster was shirking, and for
the moment Lancaster filled with passionate revolt;
but out of the wrath and clamour at the injustice
something nobler rose and conquered. He heard the
call to help that no true fighter ever denies; he saw
the young man caught in a trap too cruel for his
hesitant soul, and he put out his hand to him at once.
He looked up the table with a smile and nodded, and
as Bluecaster’s face lost its strain, and the trusting
dog-look came back into his eyes, he yielded to the
old rush of keen affection. Of course, you did things
for Bluecaster, though you damned yourself to all
eternity!</p>

<p>The decision was left to him, the one person in
the world who could not possibly see the problem
unbiassed. Even if he had not believed, there could
scarcely have been but one answer. And he <i>did</i>
believe. He did trust the Lugg. The fear that dogged
him was not of his own heart, but put into him from
outside. Brack could talk a clock into stopping.
But there was only one answer.</p>

<p>“I stand by my father’s work, of course!” he said
cheerfully, and with a passionate exclamation Brack
sank into his seat. And then old Wolf spoke again.</p>

<p>“And now you’ll let me the Pride, Mr. Lancaster!”</p>

<p>He turned to the other question with a start. Wolf
and his worries had been out of his mind for the moment.
Now they wove a thread in the weft of his father’s
warp. He hedged, trying to put the point aside.</p>

<p>“Come, Wolf, I’d hopes you’d change your mind!
It isn’t fair to your wife—I tell you that plainly.”</p>

<p>Wolf set his mouth.</p>

<p>“That’s neither here nor there!” he said doggedly.
“It’s betwixt her an’ me. I’m asking for the Pride.
I’d a reason for wanting it afore. I’ve a double
reason now. You an’ me an’ the old master, we’ve
passed our word for the Lugg. I’ll fly that flag for
the whole marsh to lift its hat! Let me the Pride!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>He leaned forward, holding out his hand in his
desire, and Brack leaned, too.</p>

<p>“You’d better go the whole hog!” he sneered.
“Here’s the proof of your trusting. Give him the
Pride!”</p>

<p>The agent hesitated, cornered and distressed. Before
his troubled vision rose a fearful old woman, terrified
to madness when the tide came in.</p>

<p>“His wife——” he began again, and Brack leaped
down his throat with a second jeer.</p>

<p>“Oh, put it on the missis! I guess a bad excuse
is better than none. Come, man, own out that
you’re not honest, or else—let him the Pride!”</p>

<p>“He’s all in!” he added, turning to Wolf with a
laugh. “Look at him! He’s chilled right through.
He’ll not give it you—not on your life!”</p>

<p>“Ay, but he will!” Wolf said quietly, his hand
outstretched. “It’s to be yes, sir, isn’t it? Isn’t it,
Mr. Lancaster?”</p>

<p>And Lanty said yes.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Out in the yard, by Bluecaster’s wheel, revulsion
swept over him. The weight he had lifted pressed
hard. He looked up sharply.</p>

<p>“You trust me too much! Will you never see
a thing with your own eyes? Suppose I’m wrong,
after all?”</p>

<p>Bluecaster, reins in hand, looked down at him with
a shamed bitterness in his face.</p>

<p>“It’s better to be wrong and a sportsman than a cur
that won’t face the drain! I wish to God, Lancaster,
you were my elder brother!”</p>

<p>Lanty rode after him across the marsh, his foreboding
heart in his stirrups. But as he began to climb at
last, and the whole panorama of eastern hills came into
view, his burden dropped from him. The die was
cast. None but a coward would wish it back. What
would come, must. He would rest content.</p>

<p>He could see the Whygills curled asleep on the
horizon, like giant elephants cuddled trunk to trunk,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
their soft, velvet, wrinkled backs hunched into the
tender sky. Below them the heather glowed pink
and rich on the dark ridges of moor. He drew a deep
breath as he rode forward, his heart eased. Yet he
had taken not only the whole of the marsh, but
Bluecaster himself into his hands.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>TERROR BY NIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Lup</span> was waiting with the boat when Wolf came down
to the channel. The tide was gone, now, but where
the old man stood the still-shining sand sucked heavily
at his boots. The son held the boat while his father
climbed in, then pushed off again in silence. They
had not spoken unless forced since the moment of
fierce contact in Lancaster’s office.</p>

<p>It is a very strong Northern trait—perhaps the
strongest of all—this absolute refusal to dig up any
subject that has once gone deep. In ungenerous
natures it takes the form of a dogged sullenness which
even Time cannot melt or break, but in the Whinnerahs
it was something finer yet even more stubborn, a
deadly aloofness, an icy withdrawal. In neither face
was there any trace of evil feeling; but in both there
was stiff-necked pride, iron resolution, unforgiving
decision. Where blood runs thickest and ties hold
closest this characteristic is most fiercely marked.</p>

<p>They parted at the bank, and Wolf’s tired limbs
took him slackly back to the homestead. His wife
had tea ready for him, but asked no questions, and he
vouchsafed no information. It was typical of him that
not until close of day did he manage to say what
waited to be said.</p>

<p>Lup had gone up to bed. They could hear him
walking about the floor of his room. There was scarcely
any light in the kitchen, for in farmland they go upstairs
early and spare the candle. The room was full
of black, shapeless shadows, and in the gray, drear
glimmer from the bay the bent figures showed a little
grayer, a little more drear. When Lup’s step had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
ceased for the night, Wolf told what had passed at
Pippin Hall.</p>

<p>She took it quietly, so quietly that alarm gripped
him, and his voice roughened as he stumbled in his own
fashion of excuse.</p>

<p>“There was a deal o’ talk among the lot o’ them,
an’ lile or nowt to show for it when all was said! I
had my own word soon on, but after that I held my
whisht till things was fixed, and then—<i>then</i> I asked
for the Pride. I’d put in for it afore, but he wasn’t
for giving it me, wasn’t Mr. Lancaster. Nay, what any
man with owt in him would ha’ done the same, after
Brack calling the old master out of his name an hour
or more! You mustn’t take it amiss, Martha. ’Twas
for the old master.”</p>

<p>“And what call had the agent to say you nay at the
start?” the thin voice asked in the dusk.</p>

<p>“Why—why I doubt it was seeing you that put
about over the water, yon day as he give us a look-in,
if you’ll think on. He would have it you’d be best off
marsh-ground altogether. It’s the Pride for me, now,
come happen what may, but if you’d likely be better
suited with your own folk over Bortun way—say, for
a bit of a spell—ay, or for good——” He slurred and
stopped, for speech was bitter, and there was a pause,
while out on the featureless night the woman’s eyes
kept vigil.</p>

<p>“Nay, I reckon I’ll bide till we’re through,” she
said at last, in the same expressionless voice. “Lup
gone, it’s not much differ what comes, one way or
another. ’Tisn’t your doing, nor even Lancaster’s.
It’s something back of us all, that drives us as stock is
driven to the butcher. ’Twas the waiting I couldn’t
abide. I’ll not fret no more, now. But all the trusting
in the world won’t stop what’s in front, cold an’ slape
an’ rivin’ an’ lowpin’——”</p>

<p>“Whisht, now, whisht!” Wolf begged, raising
himself painfully, and presently the gray figures went
wearily over the stone floor, and melted into the
blackness of the stair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>About two in the morning, Lup stirred in his still
sleep, and saw his mother standing at his open casement.
The old folk had changed their room of late
to one looking over the moss, but Lup’s faced fair and
square to the bay. It was just on tide-time, too, he
remembered drowsily, and was puzzled.</p>

<p>She had an old Paisley shawl thrown over her nightgown,
and in the glow of the dip she carried she looked
strangely young and singularly unfearful. There was
almost a smile on her face turned and lifted towards the
sea.</p>

<p>He could feel that she was waiting, and her tense
expectation kept him still. A sandbank broke away
just below with a thud and splash, weirdly loud in the
quiet. A chill snap of wind broke through the window,
flaring the flame and clattering the unfastened pane
without. An advance-battalion of raindrops smote the
glass like a challenge, and died. Stillness again, and
the waiting silence; and then out on the dark came the
steady rush of the night-wave.</p>

<p>He raised himself on his elbow, ready to go to her,
but she did not flinch as the sound filled the room, and
her face did not change, even though the after-rain,
riding on the wind, spattered through the open square.
There was a hiss in the water to-night, a muttered hint
of hate. The dead hour and the live wave together
caught him into a vague dread, and he stayed where he
was, wondering. The night and the water and his
mother’s face; for she was listening, so he felt, not
only to the incoming tide, but to something that had
as yet neither voice nor being. He almost shivered as
the pane beat against the wall like a chained and
frightened thing.</p>

<p>So long she stood, in the tossed light dipping and
leaping like a chased elf, so still she stood, her white
face strained to that which was not yet without, she
grew into his drifting dream as he dropped gradually
to his pillow. But when the water was well past, brimming
the banks and pressing fast up the bay, he heard
her draw in her breath and let it out in a great sigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>“<i>One!</i>” she said, like a prisoner counting towards
release, or a sufferer looking ahead in unbearable
pain; and then, as she had said to Lancaster, down
below: “How long? Oh, how long?”</p>

<p>Lup moved again, and this time she heard him and
came to his bed, and when she looked at him he was
not afraid any more, for her eyes, when they rested
on her son, saw nothing beyond.</p>

<p>“Nay, what Mother, you’ll get your death of cold!”
he broke out in his deep voice. “Get back to your bed.
You’ll have the old man seeking you.”</p>

<p>She stayed a moment longer, looking at his ruffled
head and drowsy eyes, but she did not speak or stoop
to kiss him—only at last stretched out one of her
strange, worn hands and smoothed the sheet under
his throat.</p>

<p>Lying in the dark when the door had closed, he
heard her in the passage. “<i>One!</i>” she said again,
like the numb stroke of a passing-bell; and through
the silent house he followed the piteous voice: “How
long? How many? How long?”</p>

<small>THE TROUBLE COMING—THE GREEN GATES OF VISION:
III. MOONLIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Lancelot</span> is a different creature to-day!” Helwise
observed, hitting hard at the empty air, and getting
the ball in her left eye for her pains. “Almost cheery
and inclined to gambol—oh, I <i>am</i> sorry! Did it hurt?
He was a little put out at breakfast, when the Duchess
of Saddleback returned him a sixpenny postal order
I had meant for a Home Tattle Limerick, instead of the
subscription he had told me to send for her Cemetery
Bazaar—Armer, please, <i>over</i> my head, not <i>at</i> it!—but
of course anybody might do a thing like that,
anybody, I mean, as busy as I am. It was the Duchess’s
letter that upset him—I don’t know why, because it
was charmingly friendly and polite. Said she hoped
the sixpence wouldn’t be too late to win him the
competition—nice of her, wasn’t it? What do <i>you</i>
think? Lancelot says that now he’ll have to double
his donation, though I can’t see any reason for it
myself. Still, he didn’t really show temper about it,
and I didn’t in the least mind asking him to check
the month’s groceries directly afterwards. Of course,
I can’t say that he showed any <i lang="fr">joie de vivre</i>—I <i>do</i>
think he’s lacking in <i lang="fr">joie de vivre</i>—but he got the
groceries to come out all right, and do you mind if we
stop?—the ball’s caught in my hair-net.”</p>

<p>“Glad to hear he’s recovered!” Harriet returned,
watching impatiently while Dandy set her hostess at
liberty. “He was just about the limit, that day at
Watters. Never saw such a jaundiced old crab-apple
in my life! Rotten of him, though, not to turn up to
bumble.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>“He’s gone to see his lordship off—your service, I
think, Miss Shaw—but he should be back presently.
He sent me down some flowers, this morning—his
lordship, I mean—and a message to say he was prevented
from calling. He makes a point of coming in
to see me, as a rule, and I tell him all the things that
want doing to the house, and we get on splendidly! I
sent him an invitation to bumble, but something always
seems to stop him. Last time it was toothache, and
the time before it was a hair-cut or a motor-smash or
some other very close shave.”</p>

<p>Dandy caught echoes of this vocal accompaniment
as she smote wildly at dancing hanks of string under
Harriet’s pitying gaze, seething with helpless rage at
the flying ball as it spun over and under and apparently
through the racquet, leaving her to plant weighty
smashes upon space or the inoffensive pole. There
was something diabolical in the way it shot down upon
you like a bolt from the blue, and caught you on the
nose when you weren’t looking. When you <i>did</i> hit
it, (which was seldom) you struck with a murderous
zest that nearly dislocated your shoulder, not in the
least with the friendly dispatch of a drive at golf, or
the <i lang="fr">esprit de corps</i> of a clean clearing-shot at hockey.
The one ball was a jolly little nipper you hoped to see
again very shortly; the other a sportsman and a pal,
the twelfth and keenest member of the team; but this
was a jeering devil and an aeroplane and a merry-go-round
and a slimy sneak, and you hit it as if you were
killing wasps.</p>

<p>She was paired against the ladies with what Harriet
called “the-man-who-scraped-up-behind,” and soon
grasped that she had cause to be thankful, since he
was not only a much better player than either of the
enthusiasts, but was also thoroughly up to their little
tricks. Occasionally he tipped Dandy a respectful
wink to leave the ball to him, or to send it over instead
of round, and she obeyed with anxious alacrity. She
soon rose to his tactics, and when she discovered that,
every time Harriet hit Armer, Armer responded by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
hitting Helwise, she made every effort to play up to
him and keep control of the ball. When, by way of a
change, Helwise hit her, and she couldn’t always
manage to hit Harriet, it was even more exciting,
though not so comfortable.</p>

<p>Even Bluecaster noticed the change in his agent as
they walked the platform together. He was accustomed
to seeing him more as a walking encyclopædia
of solid business facts than as a man with half the wine
of life yet untasted, and youth still to his hand. But
to-day he looked younger and freer than he had done
for a long time, his laugh was more ready, and his
business worries seemed shelved. Even unanalytic
Bluecaster could feel that his blood ran more strongly,
and his pulse beat quicker.</p>

<p>Bluecaster himself seemed depressed and rather
restless, one moment anathematising the delay of his
train, the next hinting that he should stay on, in a
tone that openly asked for encouragement. As the
train came in at last, he thrust an envelope into
Lanty’s hand, climbing reluctantly to his place.</p>

<p>“From that infernal Brack, I suppose!” he said
in a tone of irritation, going across to close a window
which he knew he would reopen immediately.
“There’s no name to it, and the address might have
been written with the poker, but I think it’s pretty
obvious.”</p>

<p>Lancaster took it with a shrug—the usual, cheap
envelope that carries unsigned slander. The postmark
gave no sort of clue, and the fierce venom of the
writing disguised it effectually. Within was a page
torn from the Book of Ezekiel, scored carefully so
that the phrases ran into a connected message. Lanty
read it aloud as he stood by the open door.</p>

<p>“Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Because ye
have spoken vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold,
I am against you, saith the Lord God. And mine hand
shall be upon the prophets that see vanity and that
divine lies ... and ye shall know that I am the Lord
God. Because, even because they have seduced my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
people, saying Peace; and there was no peace; and
one built up a wall ... say unto them ... that it
shall fall ... there shall be an overflowing shower;
and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy
wind shall rend it.</p>

<p>“Thus saith the Lord God; I will even rend it
with a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be
an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones
in my fury to consume it. So will I break down
the wall ... and bring it down to the ground, so
that the foundation thereof shall be discovered, and
it shall fall ... and ye shall know that I am the
Lord. Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the
wall, and will say unto you, The wall is no more ...
there is no peace, saith the Lord God.”</p>

<p>On the margin was scrawled the one word “<span class="smcap">March</span>”
in the vitriolic hand of the envelope, but that was all.
Everything else had been left to Ezekiel.</p>

<p>Lancaster looked up with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Must be Brack!” he agreed, making as if he would
tear the page across, and then, since, after all, it was
sacred speech, however distorted, folding it and slipping
it into his pocket. “The same trail of omniscience
is over it all! I ran into him in Witham on Saturday,
and suggested that, if he was really bothered over the
matter, we might put him on to some other place.
’Tisn’t business, but it might save us trouble in the
end, and Thweng won’t go wanting. However, he
wasn’t having any—talked about sticking to the ship
and holding by the fort, like Casabianca and Sankey
and Moody mixed. That annoyed me a bit, though
he was quite quiet and polite—didn’t even offer me
his confounded Turkish cigarettes! Just as we
separated, he asked quite casually whether I believed
in clairvoyance. I said no rather shortly, for I was
keen to be off. (I’d have said no, in any case, to
<i>him</i>.) Then he told me he’d come across a lot of it in
America, been rather thick with some chap who went
in for it professionally, and would have it Brack had
the gift, too. This fellow gave him some rather curious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
information—the name of the farm he would take in
England, for instance. That was certainly queer.
Thweng isn’t the sort of name you’d naturally get your
tongue round without a little assistance! He looked
as if he could tell me a lot more if he chose, only I didn’t
stop for it. He rapped out something after me, but I
didn’t catch any of it except the word ‘wool.’ Wonder
if he sits up all night with his Trilby and his Turks,
summoning spirits! He’s been fearfully ragged by
the rest of the marsh-men, by the way. Denny left
a parcel at Thweng, the other day, which turned
out to be some old bathing-togs he had dug up
somewhere!”</p>

<p>The train moved off, and he walked a few yards with
it.</p>

<p>“You won’t be up again just yet, I suppose?”</p>

<p>Bluecaster shook his head.</p>

<p>“Not to stop. I’ll run up for the Show, and I’ll
be home for the audits as usual. I’m shooting a good
bit, and then going abroad. Christmas in Cairo.
But I’ll be back altogether”—he leaned out and
called as the train gathered speed, his expression half-laughing,
half-earnest—“I’ll be back—in <i>March</i>!”</p>

<p>Lanty found his guests reinforced by Wiggie when
he got home at last. They were seated round a table
in the drawing-room, engaged in an impromptu foxhunt
evolved by the singer, by means of dice, a surprising
collection of knick-knacks, and the pot dogs
off the mantelpiece. He had spent the day in Manchester
with Hamer, and looked paler than ever and
desperately tired, but he hunted with the infectious
zest of a Troughton or a Peel. Even the host, standing
with his back to the cheerless grate, smiled as he
watched the absurd game.</p>

<p>The room was as hideously comfortless as ever, and
smelt abominably of stocks. Tea had been taken away,
and it had not occurred to Helwise to offer him a fresh
brew. A détour upstairs before entering, prompted
by some inexplicable shyness, had shown him his
dressing-table standing in water. Evidently the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
window had been open when the factotum wielded his
weekly hose. On the hall-floor he found a telegram
requiring immediate answer, and an envelope containing
money had slipped off the table into Helwise’s
umbrella. Yet he felt less irritated than usual as he
stood on his mockery of a hearth, while Wiggie, with
a throw of double sixes, sprang Climber over an imitation
brass inkstand, a framed funeral card and a mug
from Morecambe. Helwise looked happy, he thought,
tossing dice with breathless intensity. He did a great
deal more for her, every day, than this foolish young
man was doing at the moment, but it never evoked
that spirit of flagrant joy. He realised suddenly that,
in spite of her rattle-headed irresponsibility, she had
something he had not—a youth of soul at once a
blessing and a curse. Perhaps he had taken her too
seriously, demanded too much of her, not in practice,
but in temperament. The Shaws and Wiggie asked
nothing of her except to be her aimless and absurd
self. Even Harriet bullied but protected and liked
her. He alone kept her, made things easy for her, and
found her a pricking thorn. He shrugged his shoulders.
After all, it was <i>his</i> dressing-table.</p>

<p>Harriet had grabbed the only true hound in the pack,
a daintily-finished model that Bluecaster had brought
Helwise from Grasmere, and was playing in her usual
fashion, barking orders and rattling the dice like an
enemy’s brains. After Lanty came in, she barked
rather louder than before, especially at Wiggie, for
whom she seemed to have a measureless contempt.
Nobody noticed it, though, but Wiggie himself, with
all his little thread-ropes of intuition flung out like so
many cables.</p>

<p>Dandy was having very bad luck, laboriously boosting
a pincushion-backed dachshund over a pink mountain
of Lanty’s best blotting-paper. She wooed the
fates with a variety of chants and curses, but to no
purpose. For her the dice would not fall. Her cheeks
were as pink as the paper by the time Pincushion’s head
came over the hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>“He despises me for being a wretched town-person!”
she said dismally. “Wiggie’s getting on all
right, but then Wiggie’s a magician. All hairy and
feathery and furry things love him. We can’t keep
the birds out of his bedroom.”</p>

<p>“Birds in your room mean bad luck!” Harriet
observed brutally, slinging the dice-box at the magician,
and adding “Butter-thumbs!” when he missed it.
“Rotten luck—illness—death! You’d better be
making your will.”</p>

<p>A fresh shadow drifted almost imperceptibly across
Wiggie’s tired face. Dandy looked up quickly, but,
as once before, he smiled her into holding her peace,
and with a sharp fling of the dice she scrambled
Pincushion down the mountain and over a wall of
matches.</p>

<p>He took heart of grace after that, and began to forge
rapidly ahead, passing Helwise’s pug-nosed St. Bernard
and Wiggie’s black and tan with the Pomeranian tail.
Harriet’s hound was leading easily. Her fierce throws
seemed to frighten the dice into showing their most
lucrative faces. The fox—as represented by an
ancient pen-wiper lately chewed by mice—was in
imminent danger.</p>

<p>Pincushion gained, however, straining clumsily
after Cragsman’s delicate grace. The others withdrew,
leaving them to fight it out, and then a curious thing
happened. The moment Pincushion’s head drew level
with Cragsman’s lean flank, Harriet began to throw
blanks. Cragsman stayed stubbornly glued to the
same spot, while Dandy’s monstrosity, in a succession
of twos, finished the course and claimed the quarry.
Harriet reached for her gloves and announced that she
must be going. Dandy stood up, too, still looking
at the game.</p>

<p>“That was queer, wasn’t it?” she asked. “The
finish, I mean? Cragsman stopped playing!”</p>

<p>“The luck changed,” Lancaster said briefly.
“All the same, they say in the fells that if a mongrel
joins in the chase the pure-bred hound drops the fox<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
instantly. No wonder Cragsman took steck at that
overfed pincushion of yours!”</p>

<p>“I know a song about that,” Wiggie put in. “Yes,
I <i>shall</i> say it if I like!” He began to quote softly—</p>

<p>Harriet glared at him, dragging on her hard gloves
in ruthless snatches, but as he finished he lifted his
eyes to hers with a smile so full of warm goodwill that
her own dropped. Wiggie knew what the ugly room
meant to her, and the ridiculous game and the taciturn
man, where nobody else had even so much as guessed.
But then Wiggie was a magician, so Dandy had said,
and magicians don’t count.</p>

<p>Dusk was dropping as they came out of the house,
and along the quiet fields had risen the heart-high,
ghostly barriers of the mist. A far-off touch of frost
was in the air, and the clean smell of a bonfire soared
with its faint, pale smoke beyond a distant wall.</p>

<p>“I’ll walk over to Watters with you, if I may,”
Lancaster said, groping in the hall for his cap. “I’ve
papers for Mr. Shaw.”</p>

<p>“But what about Harriet?” Helwise fluttered.
“You must see her home first, Lancelot, and then you
might take Mrs. Shaw that crochet pattern she wants
for my Deep-Sea Fishermen—or was it the Night-Cap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
Club? Eight ch., 1 d.c. into sixth ch., back, 2 ch., 1 d.c.—perhaps
I’d better write it down. Of course Harriet
mustn’t go home alone!”</p>

<p>He apologised at once. Harriet generally cycled
over, and he associated her instinctively with the steel
steed that turned and rent his walls. However, she
brushed him aside with scant ceremony.</p>

<p>“Rot! Of course I can. I’m used to paddling
about by myself all over the place, and if you think
I’ll feel any braver for having a land-lunatic mooning
along beside me, grunting about turnips, you’re jolly
well mistaken! It’s no use arguing, because I don’t
mean to be bothered with you, so you can just crochet
yourself over to Watters and have done with it.”</p>

<p>She saluted the party with a side way jerk of her
head in her best ploughboy manner, and strode off,
watched by her host with annoyance, and something
else, altogether different, that held him back from
pursuit. Courtesy conquered, however, and he started
after her, only to be stopped by Wiggie. “Let <i>me</i>!”
he said, gripping his arm. “I’ll catch you up later”—and
sped away on Harriet’s swinging trail. The misty
air caught him by the throat as he ran. It had been
stuffy in the stock-scented room, and he had no wrap
of any kind. Perhaps that was why he coughed as
he came up. Perhaps he knew that she strained
hungry ears to his step, and wished to spare her even
a momentary disappointment. In any case, he was
certainly not well received.</p>

<p>“You go back!” she snapped, turning on him.
“You’re an insult—a howling insult! D’you think
I want protecting by a thing that <i>sings</i>?”</p>

<p>“I play draughts, too, you know,” he reminded her
meekly, and she laughed grudgingly and moved on
again, her escort with her. And as he went he talked—strange
talk that was new to her, talk that set the
torch of fancy flaring through the mist. Vaguely
through her dogged resistance there stole a sense of
protection that was of the soul. Physically, indeed,
she had no fear, as she had said, but the manly stride<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
had covered an effort to escape the clinging pain of
her own heart. Around her in the dusk Wiggie wove
his net of comfort, of beauty, of magic kindliness, and
by the time he let her in at her own gate, the first
bitterness was past. To-morrow she would remember
that he sang and coughed, and looked as though he
needed cod-liver-oil and malt. To-night she only knew
that an angel had walked with her.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Through the dewy garden Lanty led his guest past
the ivied seat and the pink fingers of the cherry-tree,
and so out by the little stile under the mighty shadow
of Bluecaster walls. As they passed the great, wrought
gates, already closed for the night, he caught a glimpse
of the house itself, its bare flagstaff proclaiming
mutely that the master was from home. Then they
were under the walls again, sunk in an avenue of lime,
and presently in the Lane.</p>

<p>There was the whole of wonder through the Green
Gates to-night. The chestnuts were already turning
to the pure crimson that comes with the first frost.
Already, in the little plantation backing Rakestraw,
the beeches had red at their feet. A late harvest-field,
stooked and waiting, lay wanly yellow under the
white over-world between dark building and close-laid
fence. There was a moon coming, a big moon slowly
topping the hill, and when it came the hill would go
black, and Rakestraw lights would beckon like swung
lanterns of horn. His first look was for his Mountain,
as usual, but it was not there. From the day of the
marsh-meeting he never saw his Ghost-Mountain again,
until his life had been broken utterly and utterly
re-made.</p>

<p>Dandy was thinking of Harriet as they walked in
the quiet of the Lane. Both her sudden defeat and
her violent independence had held a touch of pathos.
She asked Lanty how long he had known her.</p>

<p>“All her life, or thereabouts. Her people belong
here—good old yeoman stock, the best in the land.
The backbone of England, some of the books call it!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
It’s true, too. That’s why Harriet’s so dead sure of
herself—she’s on her own ground. She runs her own
farm with the help of a good head man. I got him
for her. It’s quite a model place; you ought to see it.
There isn’t much about farming she doesn’t know.
She’s a good hand with a plough, too, and can swing
a scythe with anybody. Oh yes, Harriet’s all right
in her own way! It’s only her manners that are
wrong, and goodness knows <i>I</i>’ve no need to talk! She
bullies you no end, but she’s absolutely straight—couldn’t
cheat if she tried. We’ve never been very
thick, she and I, but she gets on with my aunt all right,
and she’s one of our own people, and that means a lot,
after all!”</p>

<p>He laughed as he finished, surprised to find himself
so urgent in Harriet’s praise. He was thinking purely
of his offended guest, but his companion felt, as she
had felt at Watters, the intangible barrier of outlook
rise between them. She had better manners than
Harriet—yes—but she knew nothing whatever about
a farm. She was better-tempered, but she couldn’t
tell the signs of the weather. And she was decidedly
better-looking, but she couldn’t bumble or scythe or
pick out a prize hunter. And all that this first autumn
night meant to Lanty, Harriet knew as she couldn’t
possibly know. She was outside.</p>

<p>The smell of the bonfires came again—the fine,
pungent smell that is incense in country nostrils.
Lancaster lifted his head as he caught it.</p>

<p>“That’s real back-end!” he exclaimed. “Unless
you’ve lived in the country all your life, you can’t
know what it means. You need only shut your eyes,
and it paints little pictures for you. I can see things
I loved when I was a boy: shadowy autumn evenings,
driving home with my father from Witham, the long,
white road and the black hedges and the dim land.
Children running in to bed, and the cattle close under
the fence, and no birds singing—all the field-things
resting. The horse’s hoofs going clip-clop, a bit
tired, and myself snuggled under my father’s elbow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
half-asleep. The smell of the bonfires all the way—frost
coming—leaves dropping—the lights showing one
by one, and then the quiet night. The smell of the
bonfires all the way, and then—home.”</p>

<p>He was quite evidently talking to himself only, and
again isolation turned her chill. Harriet would have
known what he meant. Harriet, who nodded like
a ploughboy, was born to the mysteries of bonfires
and the back-end.</p>

<p>They reached the Third Gate in Lancaster’s Lane,
and there a big bank of mist laid its ghost-hands over
their eyes, shutting out the scene beyond. Below it,
on the soft, wet, vivid grass, was a fairy-ring. Dandy
asked the meaning of it.</p>

<p>“Fungus,” he explained, “but who wants to
believe that? Do you know that picture of Butler’s—‘Pixie-Led’—the
farm lad caught by the fairies in
the gloaming, with the mist-wreaths twining round his
knees, and the lights of the farm and the low, red sunset
behind? He looks such a clumsy, bewildered giant,
whirled round by the mischievous shreds of elves!
I wonder if he remembered or forgot? They say if you
dance with the fairies, you’re never the same again.”</p>

<p>“It’s worth trying!” she put in half-mischievously.
“They might teach me what the bonfires mean.”</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“That’s heritage—and association. By the time
you’re old you’ll understand, if you go on wanting to.
It’s the having grown with you, the being part of you,
that fills the country with glamour. Rain in the night,
the rolling of cart-wheels in the early morn, hounds
giving tongue in a soft November—things like that—they’re
riches, handfuls of gold, when you understand!”
He dropped suddenly from the heights to
tug at the ancient bars before them. “Time there was
some new timber in here, by the look of it! This
rotten stuff’ll hardly last the winter.”</p>

<p>The golden lamp of the moon was up by now, shredding
the barrier into misty scarves and skeins, and
showing green-shaded fields where turnips and potatoes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
were grown alongside. Every shadow grew pitilessly
sharp, and from the black hill-sides the lights sprang
warm.</p>

<p>“I like to watch the windows open their eyes,”
Lancaster said. “They’re so quiet, and yet there’s
all life behind them. Tragedy, often. At Oxenfoot
the old man’s dying by half-inches. Up at Topthorns
they’re slipping slowly down the fell into the workhouse.
It’s nobody’s fault, and nobody can help.
The young folk at Cowgill—bad hats, every one of
them!—make the place a hell among them, with the
hate and the quarrelling and the mean striving to best
the rest. Better things, too—men and women sticking
to in the teeth of bad luck and bad health, paying their
rent somehow, and keeping a stiff neck whatever comes
along. All life—and yet the lights so quiet and steady,
just as if peace were the real thing and the trouble
behind only an ugly shadow. You don’t remember it,
outside. You think of folk sitting happy round a fire
or at their evening meal, or slipping away quietly to
sleep. You think of home.”</p>

<p>Over Dandy, listening, came a sudden longing for
Halsted, cheerful, rampant, unmagicked, clean away
from this mist-wrapped lane and the man who made
the underneath things seem so real. They were not
hers and therefore she feared them, and though they
were not even looking at her, cared nothing for her
existence, she ran away from them in spirit as fast as
she could scamper.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t mean home to <i>me</i>!” she broke out with
reckless hurry. “At <i>my</i> home there’s a blaze from
hundreds of tantalums, and there are motor-horns
tooting on the drive and crowds of people coming up
the steps, laughing and talking. There’s dancing in
the drawing-room, and snooker in the billiard-room
and rinking in the hall. In <i>your</i> house there’s a bowl
of milk and a candle and a smoky chimney and a
hard bed”—she was half-hysterical, by now—“but in
mine there are spring-mattresses and gramophones
and Thermos flasks and electric hair-curlers——” She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
stopped, laughing unsteadily. “You’ve made me
really home-sick for the first time since I came to
Watters!”</p>

<p>He turned from the gap, rebuffed and ashamed.</p>

<p>“Afraid I’ve bored you!” he apologised bluntly.
“Why didn’t you stop me yarning? Harriet said I’d
get mooning about turnips, you know. I’ve only one
subject. You’ll soon learn to steer clear of it! That’s
Wigmore behind us, I should say.”</p>

<p>Wiggie joined them, trying very hard to put a
morning freshness into his dragging step, and because
Dandy had fallen silent, exerted himself to bridge the
gulf. He was quite willing to make an ass of himself
over the rotation of crops, if it saved her the burden
of conversation.</p>

<p>Arrived at Watters, there was no getting away from
Hamer’s hospitality, and Lancaster stayed to dinner
with a sardonic consciousness of cold sausage and
scrambled eggs awaiting him at Crabtree. They were
still at table, however, when the lights of his dog-cart
flashed on the windows, summoning him to a fire at
Far Borrans. Hamer and Dandy followed him out to
listen to Armer’s explanation. It was the hay, it
seemed—like enough the late crop had been got in too
fast—and the Hall itself was in danger. There was a
big crowd of helpers gone up, and the fire-engine was
out from Witham, as well as the small one from the
House. Armer, full of theories and excitement, had
thought the master ought to know at once. He had
brought the trap in case he was tired; incidentally,
that he might himself assist at the pageant.</p>

<p>Lanty climbed in, said good-bye, and clicked to
Blacker, but from an overgrown rambler a thick briar
reached out and held him fast. Hamer laughed as he
loosed him with difficulty.</p>

<p>“My little girl says Watters has the choosing of our
friends. It’s made a pretty tight grab at <i>you</i>, anyway!
I hope you’ll take it as an omen. See here—can’t I
run you to this farm in the car? I could have her out
in five minutes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>“Thanks, but it’s up the Dale,” Lancaster said.
“No motor-road. Narrow. Bad surface. Dangerous
to-night, with so many traps going up. I suppose
you wouldn’t care to come with me?”</p>

<p>Hamer shook his head.</p>

<p>“Not unless I’d be of use! It hurts me to see good
stuff going by the board. I’d be dreaming all night
it was Watters, and waking Mother twisting ropes out
of the sheets! I’ll have a Minimax in every corner
after this, won’t I, Dandy Anne?”</p>

<p>He linked his arm in hers, and they followed the trap
as it spun out into the main road, and turned quickly
into the Lane. Now and again, over and through the
hedges, they caught the gleam of the lamps; and once
Lanty’s head and shoulders stood out black on the
golden air. In the drawing-room at Watters, Wiggie
used the perfect artistry of his <i lang="fr">demi-voix</i> to set Mrs.
Hamer nodding over 1 d.c. between sixth and seventh
d.trs.</p>

<p>Hamer sighed in the Lane, and Dandy knew he was
away on his tram-horse hobby once more.</p>

<p>“I could have lent a hand with a bucket!” he said
regretfully, “though they’ve likely more than enough
men on the job already. I could have sent the hat
round, too, though perhaps they’d not say thank you
for that sort of thing, up here, and of course they’re
insured. But I’m a big weight. I’d have made a
difference to the going, and Lancaster was in a hurry.
But I’d have liked to lend a hand!”</p>

<p>Dandy was not listening. Their wandering had
brought them to the Gate of the Fairy-Ring, and she
drew him up to the fence. There she told him something
of the walk home and the talk that had roused
her to revolt.</p>

<p>“I’m a Halstedite still!” she said ruefully. “I’ve
no right to Watters until lean make little pictures out
of the smell of burnt wood and the flicker of a farthing
dip—until sight and sound and scent are all mixed
more or less into one. At present, when I wake to
a slow Scotch drizzle, I don’t smell violets, or see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
mushrooms rushing up, or hear cabbages taking long
drinks, but I’ve got to learn. Do you think I might
ask the fairies to put me up to a thing or two—what
‘fog’ means, for instance, and ‘hoggin’ taties,’ and
‘a good tommy-spot’; and how you ‘kill’ hay, and
why the weather is always wrong for turnips? Let
me through, Daddy dear, and I’ll see if they’ve anything
to say to me!”</p>

<p>Hamer slipped a bar and let her slide past, and with
a laugh she stepped on limber feet into the circle, a
fairy-thing herself in her white gown, with the yellow
light on her uncovered hair. But even as she caught
her dress in her fingers and pointed a foot, she checked,
her lips parted, her ear bent to listen. Lancaster’s
trap, long lost in the myriad turns of the Lane, had
emerged into the open road, and the horse’s hoofs,
quickened to a sharp trot, rang from hill to hill. There
are things to be read from a hoof-beat in the country
quiet. Up in the Dales, when a man gallops, the
farmers come to their doors, knowing he rides for
succour. Lanty’s trot spelt urgency, and more than
one voice hailed him as he passed. They heard him
answer without stopping; saw the far-off lamps flung
on the dark borders; heard the hoofs dwindle and
quicken and finally die.</p>

<p>Hamer’s wise eyes were on Dandy as she stood, her
head stooped for the last message. She had forgotten
him as well as the fairies, and her face, in its unconscious
revelation, was neither that of a spirit nor of the little
girl he loved, but the face of a woman come into her
kingdom. With a passionate sense of loss, he strode
over and lifted her out of the Ring.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>THE REAL THINGS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Brack</span> was thinking hard as he drove along the
north marsh-road, his hat pulled low over his eyes
against the evening sun. He was on his way to Ninekyrkes,
to unearth a rumour and prove it true. Talk
had it that one other on marsh-ground thought as he
did of the Lugg, felt for it the same sinister distrust.
The agent himself, at the late purgatorial meeting,
had hinted that Whinnerah’s wife was far from sharing
her husband’s attitude, and, since then, other tales
had reached his ears. He was a constant visitor at
Ladyford since his occupation of Thweng, and had
gathered by degrees that there was something curiously
wrong at the twin-farm. He meant to find out what
it was. He had known Mrs. Whinnerah in his childhood,
and even if she had been a stranger, Brack was
not the man to be deterred by shyness. He remembered
her as a delicate, highly-strung woman, with
the fated look that many carry from cradle to grave
without obvious fulfilment. She must be getting old
now, and should therefore be easily handled. If she
could be got to back his opinion, on whatever visionary
or sentimental grounds, he might yet win his throw
with the Lancasters. He had seen the young lord
waver, and guessed that to his particular temperament
a feeble woman’s mania would carry a strong appeal.
Once arouse his pity, his fear of hurting something
weaker than himself, and no amount of practical
advice would keep him from trying to right however
imaginary a grievance. Brack began to formulate
a letter from Mrs. Whinnerah, to be dictated by himself.
He was fond of framing letters. The biting word that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
goes home was to him much as a neat wrestling-chip
to his boors of cousins at Pippin. He could see Bluecaster’s
face grow troubled as he read, watch him
pen his apologetic decision to that sneering image at
Crabtree. (Brack had an imagination.) Once his
lordship was started after his red herring of justice,
the pride of the Lancasters would soon be kissing the
earth! He bit at his cigarette so savagely that it
broke in half and nearly choked him, which did not
tend to soothe a jarred temper kept on edge by a
fretted pride. He had had a bad time since the
meeting, and though his cult of super-superiority had
withheld him from the vulgarity of open retaliation,
repression had increased a passing dislike to a single-eyed
hate.</p>

<p>Born of good farm-stock, Brack had craved for so-called
higher things—he had wished to be a gentleman;
and the particular brand which had formed his ideal
he now quite adequately represented. But the red-hot
vanity that had brought him home prancing with effect
had met a rude shock. The gray, old-world atmosphere
had foiled his meretricious gentility as an ancient
manor-wall a flaring poster. Its mellow feudalism,
its pure instinct for “the real thing,” laughed at him
and cast him out. The parent-stem mocked at the
prize-shoot, and, deep down in him, something, hated
and unacknowledged, recognised its justice. Certain
colonies, indeed, in Witham and Cunswick, drawn
chiefly from other and larger towns, hailed him with
enthusiasm, but in this one instance he was true to the
soil and would have none of them. Yet the soil would
have none of him, and gave him no fellow—neither in
Bluecaster, shabby and halting, but unmistakable, nor
in Lancaster, at home in each man’s understanding,
and certainly none in Uncle Willie Holliday, that rugged
monument of fitness of place. That which was artist
in Brack, the very thing that had betrayed him, now
made hell for him where he had looked for a paradise
of approval. The bitterness of it obscured the real
motive of his late action, turning a passionate crusade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
into a petty wreaking of malice, clouding even the fear
that waked him, shaking, in the night.</p>

<p>At Ladyford alone had he found balm. Michael
Dockeray’s hospitality questioned the self-valuation
of no guest under his roof. Francey was baffling but
polite, and undoubtedly attractive, while the mistress,
playing her own mother’s-game, laid no bar to his
visits. He would call at Ladyford when he had
finished at Ninekyrkes, and have supper with them.
He lighted another cigarette, and felt vaguely comforted.</p>

<p>Ninekyrkes seemed like a house of the dead as he
came to it in the early autumn evening. Wolf and
Lup were at a shorthorn sale over at Cunswick—he
happened to know that—so Mrs. Whinnerah would be
alone. She came to the door when she saw the car,
and received his self-introduction hospitably if without
enthusiasm. She led the way into the unloved parlour,
and Brack, breathing horsehair and mustiness, was
inwardly flattered until assailed by a childish memory
of the old Lord Bluecaster at Pippin, smoking on the
settle with his feet on the hob. The old lord had
d——d the parlour, and refused to bear company with
the Family Bible. Brack had an uncomfortable
feeling that the still woman opposite would have
thought more of him if he had preferred the kitchen.</p>

<p>He talked Canada, farming, and life in general,
with the peculiar ease that comes of having left home
<i lang="fr">sans recommandation</i>, to return in your own Studebaker-Flanders,
and passed to the genial intimacy of
interrogation which Northern folk tolerate only from
their kind. Lancaster would have got his answers all
right, but from Brack it smacked of the travelling
bagman, and he discovered presently that he was
getting nothing. He dropped it, then, and struck
boldly for his point.</p>

<p>“I’ve come asking for sympathy!” he said, with a
confidential smile. “You’ll have heard about the
meeting, I guess, and how they think they’ve got the
laugh on me over the Lugg, your Wolf and the rest.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
Well, they can go on laughing till the cows come home,
but they’ll not make me take anything back. The
Lugg’s got an eye-opener safe and handy for them,
and when that comes along, I guess some of them will
laugh on the wrong side of their mouths! But I’ve
a notion—though I’m not saying why or how—that
there’s somebody thinks as I do of the crawling old son
of a gun, somebody that reckons with me that it should
never have been built—and that’s you yourself right
here, Mrs. Whinnerah! Tell me if I’m wrong. Don’t
mind me!”</p>

<p>She didn’t mind him. He was certainly wrong,
she told him, with her light, expressionless eyes fixed
on his ingratiating countenance. Foiled again, he
became less flippant.</p>

<p>“You’ll say it’s no affair of mine what you think,
but when a man has a bang-up honest conviction, it’s
up to him to get it proved if he can. I’m still smarting
at the way they petered me out. I didn’t expect they’d
catch on right away, but I did look for decent consideration.
Oh, they’ll hold to it that I’ve had it—I’ve
got <i>that</i> fixed! They’ll point to the meeting and
say the matter was fairly discussed; but they know as
well as I do that the whole arrangement was a barnstormer
fake, stage-managed down to the smallest
cue. The agent saw to that! It’s the old fairy-tale—Lancaster
fiddled and the farmers danced, and the man
shouting trouble was bucked out. I’m mighty sore
about it, I say. I meant well, and I’m sore!”</p>

<p>He was in earnest, now. He drew his chair forward,
laying his hand on the string-cover of the round table
between them.</p>

<p>“I’ll just tell you what first set me hustling Bluecaster,
and then perhaps you’ll chip in with your little
lot. Over the pond I ran up against a queer sort of
lie-slinger making a living out of telling folks’ futures
when he wasn’t getting nabbed by the police. He was
the real goods, too—I’d stake the whole Thweng outfit
on it—though I’m not saying he didn’t feather-stitch
the futures a trifle, just to make them look pretty!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
But that was when there were dollars on the game;
he got none out of me. But he digged in my hotel when
he had the cash, and the night before I sailed for
England he fetched me up on the stairs. He said:
‘You’re clearing—pulling out for England, ain’t
you?’ I told him he’d guessed it in once. ‘Well,’
he said, ‘you just keep those eyes of yours skinned!
There’s the gosh-dangdest trouble you ever struck
coming for you out of the west. There’s some sort of
mighty curiosity, wriggling like a snake, that’s getting
ready to jump its contract; and water; and dead, wet,
woolly things. I can’t see them—it’s so plum dark—only
feel them when I reach out. There’s a crack like
a gun over the sea, but you’ll not hear it when it comes,
though you’ll get cold scares many a night, waiting
for it! And where there was road there’ll be water,
water big enough to drown a house, water and wet,
woolly things——’ I told him to come off it when he
started again on the wet woollies—he was giving me the
jim-jams!—and I let him know pretty straight that I
thought he was in for the blue devils, but he was too
slick in earnest to take me up. He said he couldn’t
fix it plainer, but I’d find it shine up brisk enough when
the clock struck. ‘It’ll beat hell!’ he said. He
told me I could see it for myself, if I’d practise a spell,
that I’d the power as good as he had. I got him to
show me how”—he laughed rather uncomfortably,
looking away—“and I guess I know what the wet
woollies are, anyway! He told me what farm I’d
fixed on, after a deal of teeth-grinding and eye-rolling—it’s
a bit of a twister for the psychic tongue, you’ll
admit! and then he said: ‘There’s somebody else
knows the last card in this deal—somebody in England.’
That’s what he told me, Mrs. Whinnerah, and
I want to know! ‘There’s a woman over there
powerful scared’”—he eyed her searchingly—“‘a
woman scared clean out of creation——’”</p>

<p>The faintly-ironic lips opened at last.</p>

<p>“Ay? An’ did he tell you as our bull-calf had slipped
shuppon an’ was lakin’ wi’ yon steam-engine o’ yourn?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>Brack’s superiority broke on a curse as he tore out
to the car. The concrete facts that the bull-calf had
smashed his off-lamp and horned fancy patterns on his
paint did not lessen his chagrin at his mental defeat.
He turned irritably on the calm old woman watching
from the porch.</p>

<p>“It’s the old wheeze—the same old fusty old
wheeze! ‘What a Lancaster says, goes!’ It’s
Lancaster and Lancaster to it. Guess the whole lot
of you’ll be something struck of a heap when they turn
out plaster imitations at the Judgment!” He leaned
on the car, looking at her with tense impatience.
“You’ll not speak, but there’s folks in plenty putting
words in your mouth. Now just listen right here!
It wouldn’t take more than a cent’s-worth of shove
to set his lordship against the Lugg for good and all.
I had him wobbling, as it was. <i>You</i> can put the cinch
on him, if you choose. Lancaster’s only a paid
servant, when all’s said, and he’d have to knuckle
under. You’ll never go to the Pride, with the fear
of the sea on you, just to help the Lancaster tradition
make good? I hope to God I may see them fired out
of the countryside before I’m a year older, humbled
and cursed and damned and broke!”</p>

<p>She looked at him straightly, then, answering him
straightly for the first time.</p>

<p>“I’ve nowt to say to you, Brack Holliday, and them
as says I have, lies! Who made the likes o’ <i>you</i> judge
betwixt me an’ the Lancasters? But I’ll tell you
what it is—you’re an over-throng, fidging, meddling
jammy-lang-neck, as teptious as a wamp! You’re
nowt but a daft rabbit scuttling to ground afore a
storm. It’s not <i>you</i> that has anything to fear, and
them as has can get through it without your help.
There’s bigger things than you in this world, Canada
Brack—ay, and a parlish lot o’ bigger folk an’ all!—and
happen you’ll learn it sooner than late!”</p>

<p>She wiped him out of existence with her old stare
over the sea, and, raging but silenced, he turned the
Flanders to the gate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>By contrast, the atmosphere of Ladyford was all
pure comfort and grace. Here he was an honoured
guest. Here he could flow conversationally without
fear of ironic silence. The string of self twanged
joyfully in the breath of Mrs. Dockeray’s admiration.
It was pleasant to sup to the sauce of her interest, to
see Rowly’s eyes widen at his effects. Still more
pleasant to stand behind Francey at the piano, asking
in a light tenor, from a far-off point not specified, if
they thought of him in the Dear Old Home. But it
was rarest of all to sit opposite to her, watching her
pale cheek bent over her knitting, while her mother,
with discrimination almost too marked for comfort,
called attention to his good points.</p>

<p>“It’s just as I’ve always said! There’s nowt like
seeing the world—having a bit of a look round, if it’s
only over the near wall into the next bull-coppy!
Westmorland folks is that set on their own yard o’
ground, it takes a travelling-crane to hawk ’em out.
Why, Brack, it doesn’t bear thinking on what-like
you were as a lad, popin’ about like a yard o’ pump-water,
wi’ toes turning in an’ chin poking out—a
reg’lar daft-watty! And now you’ve come back real
quality, talking as like his lordship as two peacocks,
and in a deal better fettle an’ more than a deal better-like!
It fair frets me thinking of folk—folk I could
put a name to—slouching and talking broad, clumping
about in great boots and smelling of the shuppons, with
never a thought to spare above stock, an’ never a word
to throw at a dog! You’ve capt the lot of us, my lad,
showing folks what they can frame for if they’ll
nobbut try!”</p>

<p>Brack glowed, seeing himself winsome and well-tailored,
elegant, cultured, “arrived,” but before the
women’s eyes rose Lup in his still, dumb dignity of the
soil. Mrs. Dockeray was playing high. Armoured
in commonplace virtues duly admitted, he would have
stood little chance beside Brack’s glistening veneer; but
mockery and contempt could not but give him place
even in the most grudging imagination. Something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
of the pathos and power of Millet’s “Angelus” clung
about him under her rough touch, showing him
in full and beautiful accord with both earth and
heaven. Unfortunately, Lup himself, coming in with
Michael just as they sat down to supper, dispelled the
illusion more than a little. His “bettremer” clothes
were heavy and ill-cut, foiling the plate-glass impressions
to which Brack added grace. His old-fashioned
“bowler,” several sizes too small, gave him the
anxious air of an uncertain juggler, while an astonishing
red-and-yellow handkerchief of his father’s shrieked
at Brack s peeping square of white silk. He followed
Michael in with a forgotten catalogue, and was for
making off again when Mrs. Dockeray netted him with
cumbrous but sure sweep.</p>

<p>“You’ll stop and have a bite with us now you’re
here, surely! It’s not so many more chances we’ll
have of a crack with you. Wolf’ll likely be set on
getting back, so we’ll let him be, but I’ll not take nay
from you, Lup, so you can just set yourself down!
There’s Brack here with all Canada at his finger-ends,
ready to learn you anything you’ve a mind to, an’ a
deal more, I reckon! I’m real glad you looked in.
The master’s never a word for us home-keeping folk
after sales an’ such-like. He’s that weary he gets
sluming in his chair afore he’s half-through, and it’s
vexing when one’s aching for a bit o’ news. Brack’s
not been; leastways, he’s never mentioned it.”</p>

<p>“Oh say! I have, though,” Brack put in hastily,
conscious that his perfunctory interest in the sale of
an historic herd was bound to go against him. “Guess
I was too taken up to remember. I’d other business
shouting, but I just blew over for a spell—thought it
was up to me to give ’em a look-in.” As for the stock,
it had been very much over-rated, he considered. All
the best stuff went over the pond; everybody knew
that, and he happened to be able to confirm it. Lup
would find it so for himself when he got across. Yes,
sir, <i>he</i> had been at the sale, right enough! That was
the best of a car; you could whiz about all over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
the place, and see a chunk of everything that was
going.</p>

<p>“You stopped just on half an hour,” Lup put in,
fixing him steadily across the table. “I saw when you
come—you were having a bit of a turn-up with the
Duke’s shover; and I saw you quit—at the tail of a
cart to the first motor-shop. And the biggest stock
wasn’t in the ring till you’d been gone more than a
while. It was a rare good sale. There’s no finer
beasts in the world.”</p>

<p>Brack felt his halo dwindling.</p>

<p>“Engine-trouble—fixed in five minutes!” he
answered casually. “No use my stopping, anyway—prices
ran too all-creation big. You feel mighty
thrilled, of course, watching good stock put to the
hammer, even when you’ve got to grit your teeth on
your tongue to keep it mum, but I d another trail to
follow. I don’t mind laying that half the farmers
there went just for the fun of the circus—they weren’t
out to buy. You and your father, I take it, weren’t
on to anything, now that Ninekyrkes is changing hands,
and you’re for out West?”</p>

<p>Lup flushed, and fell into dogged silence. The
afternoon had been bitter as Dead Sea drink. Time
and again the surface of the situation had been explained
to inquiring minds, and in most cases had
met with disapproval. More than one county gentleman
had buttonholed him, asked his plans, and dropped
him with a shrug. His father’s contemporaries had
wagged censuring heads, and, as often as not, a tongue
to match. Already he felt something of an outcast.
Not that he really cared a whit for condemnation.
It would be a poor-blooded Westmorland farmer that
even looked aside at criticism; but where his pride
had shaken off concern, his heart had not gone unscathed.
Even on his accustomed gaze the pathos of
old Wolf had smitten hard. He knew afterwards—months
afterwards—that this was the last happy day
the old man ever had. Mixing with the huge crowd
in the beautiful park, greeting and greeted at every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
step, tuned to the excitement of a big sale, he was
young and keen again, forgetting the future. On this
happy flickering of dead joy it was Lup’s business to
lay the chill, extinguishing hand of reality. He
wondered how often he had reiterated the same dull
speech: “Nay, father, what we want no more wi’
stock, you’ll think on!” just as he had wondered, each
time, how soon he would have to speak it again. It
was like killing something that would not die, and in
spite of his efforts the old man had insisted on bidding
at Rosedale Queen, until Lup had sought out Lancaster
and begged him to bring him to reason. Somehow
Lanty had succeeded, and Wolf had dropped out, his
eager desire followed by a piteous apathy. The agent
stayed near, trying to cheer him, but with little result.
Old Wolf’s swan-song, he thought, had been that
frenzied bidding at Rosedale Queen.</p>

<p>Brack had the whip of the conversation again, and
was making the most of it. All Mrs. Dockeray could
elicit from Lup was that Rose Diamond had sold for
two hundred and fifty guineas, or that Denny had
picked up Rosedale Squire for seventeen, and already
saw himself beating the King at the Royal—statements
barely stemming the steady flow of Brack’s assurance.
The mother fretted and wondered, watching the girl’s
eyes as they travelled between the two, weighing them
in the balance.</p>

<p>But Francey could not look at them as she, at the
same age, would have looked. In the daughter’s case,
education of a high class had sharpened the over-critical
faculty of a fine intelligence until it held her emotional
capacity captive. She saw them more as types than
as human flesh and blood. She could neither be fascinated
by the surface charm of the one, nor lose herself
in the primitive strength of the other. Behind Brack’s
refinement and overplayed ease she saw that he was
restless, meretricious, lacking in stability. Around
Lup’s steady sanity and simple faith she felt the rough
shell of his ignorance. Lup saw as his fathers saw,
loved as they loved, glimpsing life sharply but narrowly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
not in the least with her wider if more dangerous vision.
There were depths in her he would never fathom,
finenesses he might respect but never grasp, shades of
feeling making life vivid that he would always fail to
seize. Brack could seize them, after his own fashion.
She could feel him follow her mood almost as it turned
its coat, where Lup would have been blundering up
blind alleys, or sitting dumbly at corners, waiting her
return. Her interest quickened, so that Brack flattered
himself and shone. It was with real reluctance that he
tore himself from his thrilling attitude of cock-o’-the-midden.</p>

<p>“Guess I feel leaving Ladyford like leaving home!”
he said sentimentally. “I saw mighty little of hearth
and home for many a long year.” (The string of
the exiled orphan-nephew twanged with fine effect.)
“Lup, I sure envy you, hanging out just over the way!
Why didn’t you hit the trail last year, old man? I’d
have had Ninekyrkes, then, instead of Thweng. You’d
have found me real neighbourly, Mrs. Dockeray!”</p>

<p>The words were meant for Francey, with the tail of
an eye on Lup, for he knew well enough the talk
that was going; but if he expected to score he was
disappointed.</p>

<p>“Folk have it you’re feared of a marsh-farm,” the
other said indifferently. “Over much water about—sets
you dreaming-like! It’s only a dowly sort of a
night. You’d best to see to your lamps. I’ll fix yon
far gate for you. It’s a trick o’ swinging.”</p>

<p>He rose and went out, but not before he heard Brack
beg the girl for a meeting at the café in Witham, with
a ride in the car to follow. As a preliminary canter,
he cajoled her into letting him run her to the far gate,
just to show he was to be trusted. She came, to his
surprise, but when he would have taken her hand in
farewell, she had already melted into shadow behind
the car, and the gate, under Lup’s ruthless propulsion,
was closing steadily upon him. To save his wings he
cleared quickly, his fetich of gentility forcing him to
shout a cheerful gratitude he was very far from feeling.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
Well, she would drive with him, yet; though after a
fashion of which he could not dream.</p>

<p>The night was drear. The dark had none of the
velvet comfort that goes with the soft blackness before
the rising of the moon. Its touch was harsh, its
suggestion sinister. The elm over the gate creaked
with rheumatic movement, while the brittle autumn
leaves whispered restlessly, like sleepers too tired to be
still. The couple stayed beneath.</p>

<p>“You’ll be meeting him, likely?” Lup asked
suddenly, with no hint of jealousy or vexation in his
voice. He had taken his dismissal, and had no
intention of presuming on old rights.</p>

<p>“Not I!” Francey answered, with a touch of
impatience. “Why, they say he takes a different girl
to the café every week! The men in the smoke-room
run a sweep as to which it will be! I came down in the
car for fear you got across with him. He was a bit
above himself to-night, our friend Brack.”</p>

<p>“You were getting on with him rarely at supper.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” She fell thoughtful. “I can talk to him,
but that’s all. It’s like playing a game with somebody
of your own form for the sheer pleasure of being in
sympathy with that side of them. You may not give
a snap of the fingers for them otherwise, but at the
moment it doesn’t count. <i>You</i> don’t feel like that,
do you?”</p>

<p>“No,” Lup said simply. “I like folks, or I can’t
abide them. I’m keen to clap eyes on them and have
a crack, or else I want no dealings with them whatever.
I’ll not drink with them, nor sell with them, nor pass
the time o’ day unless I’m put to it. I’ve no use for
them at all.”</p>

<p>“That’s simple, Lup, but it’s blind—blind and
narrow! Folk are not all white or black; they’ve
different sides, different shades. You can pick out
the one you want, and leave the rest. Even Brack
has his points.”</p>

<p>“Like enough,” he answered carelessly. “He’s
welcome to them as long as he keeps out of my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
road——” and she laughed a little and was silent.
Brack’s “points” did not interest her overmuch,
either.</p>

<p>They had not quarrelled, these two. Even in the
first bitterness of rejection he had recognised that she
was not moved by cruel or petty perversity. She had
simply faded out of his reach when he was surest of her,
retreating behind some barrier which would fall to
neither of them. He had certainly been passionately
hurt and deeply angry, but he had never been unjust.
Unable to see her standpoint, he yet bowed to it; only
he could not bring himself to stay and suffer.</p>

<p>“When do you go?” she asked suddenly. He
told her, and then: “<i>Need</i> you go?” she added
somewhat nervously, Lancaster’s embassy in mind.
“There’s your father and mother—you could keep
away—<i>need</i> you go?”</p>

<p>He answered briefly, turning his head away from her
even in the darkness, and she held her tongue; but
after a while she began again in stumbling, disjointed
phrases like bodiless thoughts not shaped for the
clothing of speech.</p>

<p>“It’s my fault—but why? What is it? You’d
be good to me, but I want so much. I’m several
people, and all asking. One of me loves you, but not
all—no, not all! One of me is afraid—that’s the
strongest one. There are so many closed doors. Can
anybody be happy in a single room? Or are there
new rooms for us to find together that I don’t know of,
now, so that the closed doors wouldn’t matter? If
only I knew! If only you could tell me! Suppose
the one room was a prison for always? How am I to
know?”</p>

<p>He moved uneasily, and she pulled herself up and
made an attempt at coherence.</p>

<p>“Marriage isn’t just one thing to me; it’s all—love,
companionship, understanding for always. How can
I face closed doors through Eternity? You love me,
but half I say has no meaning for you, half I feel passes
you by even when we’re nearest. It isn’t your fault;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
it isn’t mine. You’re patient with me, but even love
and patience are not enough. All the time we’re both
of us groping, you for light and I for touch. You’re
gentler than your father, but at the bottom you’re
alike. You believe in the same things, you feel about
them in the same way. You were vexed for my sake
when he forced us into each other’s arms over the farm,
but you didn’t feel that he caught up our dream in
rough hands, and made it coarse and common. It
was right and natural to you, perhaps even beautiful.
Perhaps it was I who broke the glamour for <i>you</i>—I
hadn’t thought of that! But I had to do it. I
should do it again. What are the real things—the
things that matter?” And for the second time she
said: “How am I to know?”</p>

<p>He had been standing looking away from her, but
now he turned and took her gently in his arms, with
one hand raising her face as if it had been a child’s.
Perhaps it came to him that in her doubt and trouble
she was indeed a child to his certainty of purpose.
All her acquired wisdom could not give her the unclouded
sureness that love had taught him long since.</p>

<p>“The real things are the old things,” he said.
“They’re all I know, but I reckon you’d find them
enough if you’d only believe it. I’d bide if I thought
I could learn you, but I doubt you’re a long way off,
and I can’t stop on as things are. I’d sooner be shot
than have to stand it out—the never knowing when I’d
be seeing you, the hearing and feeling you all around
me, and not mine. D’you think I’d not know, passing
the house, whether it had you inside of it, or turn a
bend and not go sick with longing for you and fear to
meet you? One of us must shift, and it can’t be you.
It’s not for you to leave your folks and fend for yourself—it’s
for me. I wish the old man didn’t take it
so hard, but this is <i>my</i> job, and I’ve got to quit. As
for you, I reckon you’ll see clear some day, when you’re
older. You’re only a bit of a lass yet—I forget it,
you’re that wise! I don’t rightly know what you mean
about closed doors. A man and a woman each has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
thoughts the other can’t hold with—they’re made
different; but when they’re man and wife there’s a
lot they can share together as they’d likely have never
known, wanting one another. It seems to me that it’s
made up that way. I can’t talk to you like Brack.
I reckon I’m not sorry, neither, but I’m not that sort,
anyway. I’ve my mind a deal on my work, as you
don’t need telling, but it’s my heart as really learns
me the things that matter. They’re few enough—ay,
but they’re big enough too! Just trust in the
morning and quiet in the evening, our own folk, and
work, and food and sleep—seed-time and harvest,
cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night—the
things the folks behind us knew afore we were born.
The real things are the old things.”</p>

<p>They went back to the beckoning porch in silence.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>And all night long, in his troubled sleep, Wolf was
bidding at Rosedale Queen.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>HAMER’S FIRST TRAM</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the country there are houses far more truly the
recipients of formal visits than their occupants, just
as, at public functions, your carriage comes up to
your place’s name instead of your own; for master
and tenant pass away, but the House remaineth. You
do not call “on” Bythams, Lyndesays and Wyllens;
you call “at” Gilthrotin, Crump or The Laithes.
It is the house that stands on your visiting-list,—that
has become a habit; and your dropped pasteboard is
for its door rather than for those beneath its roof.</p>

<p>Watters was one of these “habits,” but the Legend
of the Kitchen Tea, mysteriously promulgated and
enlarged, held many aloof who had no particular axe
to grind. Mrs. Shaw, divided between crochet and
creameries, was indifferent to the quality and size
of their social circle. Hamer, sweetly taking the
grinders at their personal estimate, was unconscious
of any difficulty. It was only Dandy on whom the
situation, seen more clearly, pressed unkindly.</p>

<p>She began to grow suspicious of callers, to strain
her ears when the sound of the grinding was low,
waiting for it to start up with the roar of a motor-cycle.
She came to know the grades in leeches—the
business-leech and the hobby-leech and the charity-leech
and the soul-leech. No matter what their
particular goal, it was reached by the same path—Hamer
Shaw’s cheque-book. The grinders did not
want money, as a rule. Their needs as well as their
methods were more subtle, based upon the pure ethics
of elections, local, general or “by,” demure eyes
turned upon next year’s voting-register. It was most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
of it “by,” Dandy reflected, watching their tortuous
procedure. On the whole, she preferred the leeches.</p>

<p>She began to wince a little when Harriet, cheerfully
unconscious of having helped the Legend on its way,
took it for granted that their acquaintance was in
common; and though, at Dandy’s disclaimer, she
would grunt “Cat-footers! Gees out of repair or
something!” her contempt for the ostraciser did little
to soothe the soul of the ostracised.</p>

<p>Visiting Harriet’s farm, Dandy had come, with some
surprise, upon Harriet’s father. Harriet seemed to
stand so very much alone; you did not credit her
with such weaknesses as near relations. Yet Fawcett
Knewstubb was a distinct weakness, a very delicate
spot indeed. He was very horsy, very check and
utterly selfish, and a really strong connoisseur in
language and whisky. Harriet kept him and his
hunters, called him “Stubbs!” in the voice of a
sergeant, and wished him dead, in a bitter heart.</p>

<p>Hamer and his daughter motored to Bluecaster
Show along a road swarming with enthusiasts who had
no notion of making room for anybody. Dandy felt
more of an outsider than ever in the crowded field, with
its jumping and cattle rings, its tents, its long lines of
wooden stands. She saw many faces she had come to
know, but few held return signs of recognition. The
usual people were busy greeting each other, very
contented, very much at home. They were there
because they had always been there, since the time
they could first sit on a stand without falling through.
After the greetings, they buried their heads in their
catalogues and slouched along from pen to pen, walking
blindly into everybody else, and offering information
to the empty air. Anxious to do the thing thoroughly,
Dandy and Hamer bought catalogues and slouched,
too. By this means they were successful in running
into Harriet, leaning up against something extremely
solid with four legs and a horn or two, gloating over
the blue-ribboned card opposite. When Hamer’s
catalogue knocked her hat sideways, she merely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
remarked “How’s that for beef?” and continued to
gloat. It was a minute or two before they could call
her back to earth, but as soon as she realised their
existence she left off gloating, and trotted them round
the field in a terrific whirl of instruction, leading them
at last, somewhat stunned, to a seat on the Grand
Stand.</p>

<p>The day was brilliant, but Harriet, defended against
all odds by Donegal, Burberry and K., with a huge
carriage-umbrella tucked under her arm, insisted
stoutly that you never could tell. It always rained
at Bluecaster Show—everybody knew that—and it
would rain to-day; this in a tone indicating that it jolly
well better had. Dandy, dressed with the delicacy of
a Blue Wyandotte, felt abashed until she discovered
that Harriet was practically alone in her gloomily-barometric
choice of attire.</p>

<p>Ringed in its green cup brimmed by blue hills, the
scene had its own untheatrical charm, but its thrills
were mild and long in arriving. Business went forward
with little regard to spectators, and after a tedious half-hour,
during which four horses, eight cows and twelve
sheep stared solemnly at the crowd, while the whole
Committee got down into the ring and wrangled about
them, she found her thoughts straying to the social
ethics of the meeting.</p>

<p>There was a rail dividing the stand, cleaving the two-shilling
section from the half-crown. This puzzled
her, as the planks on either side were equally hard.
Harriet’s explanation that you got sixpenny-worth
more water-jump scarcely seemed to go deep enough.
The grinders were half-crowners, she noticed, glued
as a rule to the side of some local celebrity, such as the
Member or the High Sheriff or the President; but the
leeches only ran to two shillings—with the exception
of Helwise, who was inviting Bluecaster to come and
see how badly they wanted a new bath at Crabtree,
when she wasn’t issuing orders to Lanty in the ring.</p>

<p>Apart from his aunt, Lancaster was having the usual
harried time of an authority on these occasions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
When he wasn’t helping or looking for the judge, he
was calling competitors or catching stray sheep,
artfully eluding business-demands from button-holing
tenants, or rescuing the usual veterans of the ring who
stand so trustingly behind the hurdles. He knew
everybody, it seemed, just as Helwise, talking baths,
knew everybody, and Harriet, flourishing her clumsy
gamp. Names passing from mouth to mouth were no
more than empty sound to herself. The fact that
Seaman was jumping did not fill her with anticipation,
nor could the recent death of a well-known horseman
move her to a sense of loss. She began to be rather
bored by the unhurrying succession of events, and
checked herself guiltily in a yawn. The judge of the
moment was having a real day out with a fine hunter-class,
and had to be practically dragged off each horse
in turn. Hamer was drinking in Harriet’s observations
like an eager child, but he was as new to it all as his
daughter.</p>

<p>Even the old hands were getting a little weary, and
found time to turn a speculative eye upon the strangers—the
cheery, handsome man and the slim, well-groomed
girl; and the Legend went round in ascending
chromatics of incredulity. Some knew Hamer by
accident, so to speak: “Behaved very decently over
that Abbey Corner smash, don’t you know! Sporting
and all that—gave a thumping big subscription to
to-day’s business,” etc. etc., and wondered vaguely
whether he might not be worth cultivating. The
women with sons looked at Dandy and said that anybody
married anybody nowadays, and that even
Kitchen Tea might be made positively chic if the
butter were spread thick enough. The women with
daughters only were not interested.</p>

<p>Dandy had ceased to be self-conscious, however.
She was watching Lancaster at work with the same
dreary chill of separation that she had experienced in
the Lane. This was his life, this interchange of business
and friendship to which she was an absolute
stranger. Harriet was perfectly at ease in it, grumbling,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
grunting, cracking a joke with a passing farmer or
summing-up a prize-winner in a pithy sentence—at
ease and happy.</p>

<p>“Dull enough to <i>you</i>, I expect,” she observed,
detecting Dandy’s secret yawn. “We’re brought up
to it, of course. Besides, it’s my trade. Rotten show,
though! Rotten judging! Fool of a crowd! But
all the same I couldn’t stop away, any more than
Lanty Lancaster. I’ve grown to it, you see. When
I was a kid it was my big blow-out of the year, and
I’ve still got the same feeling for it, like Christmas
Day and all that piffle. It isn’t the thing itself—it
gets slacker and rottener every year, as I’m always
telling them, especially Lanty Lancaster—it’s what it
stands for, and all the years behind it. If ever I want
to purr, it’s when I’m sitting on this shaky old stand,
watching a flat-footed imitation of a horse going slap
for the water. But you must be about fed up on it,
I suppose! It’s as slow as Noah’s Ark, and, besides,
it always rains.” She slipped the catch of the gamp
to see if it worked, and shot a glance at the sun which
should have sent it slinking over the horizon like a dog
shouted to kennel. “We’re getting through to the
jumping, though. You’ll find that a bit more enlivening.
Stubbs is turning out—did I tell you? He’s got
a mount that can jump about as much as a hedgehog,
but he thinks he’s going to win all right. It’s no use
<i>my</i> jawing; he won’t take anything from <i>me</i>. I hope
he’ll behave decently, that’s all, and not get slanging
the judges. Trust Stubbs to have been where the sun
is shining, even though it always rains!”</p>

<p>The band behind the stand broke into a dirge which
proved to be “The Girl in the Taxi,” and to this suitable
<i lang="fr">motif</i> the leapers sidled into the ring for their primary
reconnaissance. There was something of the dignity
of ritual in their solemn progression from fence to
fence, in the measuring thrust of the intelligent heads
through the furze. Dandy had her first thrill in spite
of the accompaniment. She wanted to beat a little
drum in the wake of the processional hoofs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>Harriet knew the riders, gentleman, groom or horse-dealer,
just as she knew the mounts,—from the hunter,
that did a little gentle following of hounds by the aid
of gates, to the professional “leppers,” that never see
open country, but spend their time winning prizes at
a round of shows, and jump more with their brains
than with any other section of their queer-shaped
carcasses. She dragged out a pencil like a poker, and
settled down to work.</p>

<p>“That’s Captain Pole-Pole on Griselda, the little
gray. Rushes everything that she doesn’t take steck
at, and a brute to hold, by the look of her. The big
roarer waving its wild tail and doing an imitation of a
charging squadron belongs to Bluecaster. Lanty
has her out for the fun of the thing. They call her
something idiotic—oh, yes—<i>Flossie!</i> She can jump
quite a bit—Heaven knows how—though you can feel
the stand shake. There’s a groom up—plays the
triangle in my village orchestra. The thing called
Chipmunk, looking as though it was made of knitting-needles,
belongs to the Ritson Bros. One’s riding,
and the other runs in and throws things if Chippie
starts frivolling. There’s the winner—the little brown
like an oak box with head and legs. You’d think he
hadn’t the reach for a grass-plot rail, but he’s there,
every time. Watch his eyes, and his good-tempered
ears! He’s as pleased as Punch all along, and as dead
in earnest as a city man sprinting for his train. Yes,
he’ll win right enough! Why? Because he jumps
with his head. You can see him stop to think just
before he takes off, and he doesn’t give the fence an
inch more than is wanted. This is his living—he
comes from Saddleback way—and little Seaman
doesn’t mean to waste himself playing round. Stubbs
must be cracked to think he can beat him! The
rough-looking black with the rope-reins has been
taught to behave like a mad circus and an Ulster riot
combined. Its owner is a blacksmith in his spare time,
and nobody else can stick on its back. It’s clever, too,
but it’s apt to get carried away by its play-acting and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
make mistakes. Flyer goes to sleep and leaves his
heels behind him, and Grace tries to do the tight-rope
act on the pole with all four feet at once. That’s
Stubbs on his beetle-crusher—Lapwing, <i>he</i> calls it!
He doesn’t look any too genial, does he? We had a
row before starting about rotifers, if you know what
those are—some sort of a measly swimming microbe
or rotten reptile of that kind. It’s the only thing he
cares a rap about except horses and the inside of a
glass, and he was ramping mad because some of the
beastly things had got thrown away. I hope Lanty
is somewhere about.”</p>

<p>Stubbs was immense—very check, very baggy, and
very red in the face. His side-whiskers bristled
aggressively, and there was a vicious gleam in his eye.
He was riding a boring chestnut with weak quarters
and the action of a schoolboy in clogs. Harriet dug
the person in front of her with the gamp by way of
relieving her feelings. Hamer and Dandy tried to
think of things to say, but she cut them short.</p>

<p>“Oh, it won’t be the first time he’s made fools of
us both in public! I can’t help feeling a bit grubbed,
but I suppose I can stick it out. Anyhow, I’ve got to
stop and see him through. Save them hunting me
up, if he goes and breaks his neck.”</p>

<p>She thrust her hands in her pockets and scowled.
Lapwing had already collided with the brown, and
Stubbs, ripe for fight, was beginning to explode. The
quiet little boy on Seaman stared in astonishment until
Lancaster, coming up, laid a palm on Lapwing’s poking
nose and drew him out of range. He had some tale
ready, peculiarly adapted to Stubbs’ appreciation,
and Harriet caught her father’s guffaw as he rode to
his place. She sighed sharply—with relief, Dandy
judged—and addressed herself to shouting “Good
lad!” or “Good lass!” with supreme and delightful
unconsciousness of self.</p>

<p>The sleepy Flyer led off, and left everything in ruins
behind him, after which there was a lengthy pause,
while rails and bricks were replaced and furze-tops<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
refixed. Griselda gave a charming illustration of the
so-called feminine temperament, refusing to look at any
jump until forced upon it, and then flying it with a
complete trust in Providence and an absolute disregard
of economy. After these, the performance of the
Bluecaster warrior ranked high, in spite of the roaring
and waving accompaniment, and a suggestion of
clanking chains as she rocked past. Carrying her
proud head at the noble angle affected by some ladies
much engaged in good works, she yet contrived, by
dint of squinting down her nose at the last moment,
to view a jump in time to clear it, and thundered on to
the next in an atmosphere of escaped earthquakes.
In spite of her size and weight, she tackled the trap
quite neatly, and roared down the field to the water.
Here she was superb! On the wings of sound she came,
gathered herself into a mighty bunch, plunged and
was over, leaving mingled impressions of trumpets,
bazaar-bunting and a motor-exhaust.</p>

<p>Chipmunk did quite a good round, thanks to a
continuous shower of hats, sticks and ear-splitting
yells; but Grace’s tight-rope effects were unsuccessful,
except with the pole, on which she managed to do quite
a delicate little bit of work. Lucifera, the black, was
greeted warmly by the crowd, to whom she was well
known, and responded by putting her back into things,
like any other popular clown. Nothing grudging, she
gave them all her tricks, from the preliminary, vicious,
white-eyed sidle and spin to the last terrific bound
with which she caught the bit in her teeth and rushed
the obstacle. She missed the water, however, by
trying to do a circle on the back outside edge too far
up the field, but made up for it by leathering off
into the crowd with a splendid impersonation of a mad
runaway.</p>

<p>Little Seaman had only one mannerism, a circular
trot like the weaving of a spell that seemed to wind him
up for the first hurdle. Dandy’s heart went out to the
sensible, eager, square little horse with the box-legs.
He might have been a machine measured to each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
length and lift, so obviously did he spare unnecessary
effort, had it not been for clear evidence of mind
behind, of humanly-patient intelligence and endeavour.
At the water, his customary check drew a groan of
disappointment, changing to applause as it was seen
that he was safely across. Certain ladies were so ear-piercingly
enraptured that he had to drop on his knees
and bow his little box-head before trotting soberly
back to his place.</p>

<p>And, at last—Stubbs.</p>

<p>It was perfectly clear that Nature had never intended
Lapwing to “lep”; clearer still that Lapwing was
entirely of Nature’s opinion. He was born tired; his
foolish head had a weary droop; his heavy hoofs were
in curious contrast with his weedy frame. What he
could not walk through, he sat on behind. When
driven to rise, he hit the swing-gate with such force
that he nearly looped the loop along with it. He
bundled into the trap like a sack of old clothes, utterly
abolished the stone wall, and plumped slick into the
water, where he stayed determinedly, in spite of the
volcanic eruption in the saddle. Lancaster removed
the pair once more, this time with difficulty. Harriet
flushed a little under the joy of the crowd, but she said
nothing, only gave the same sharp little sigh as she
watched the retreating figures and the soothing hand
on the check knee.</p>

<p>The second round brought its own disasters. Flyer
had finally gone to sleep for the afternoon, and was
withdrawn. Chipmunk missed the gate, owing to
there being no hat handy. Griselda and Grace both
foozled the wall, the one from temper and the other
from silliness, and Flossie was so busy being noble
that she forgot to squint at the trap and was caught.
Lucifera, excited by the crowd, began to overact,
tried to sit on the shilling stand and broke a stirrup-leather.
Only Seaman steadily kept his form—and
Stubbs.</p>

<p>Lapwing came out as if he were going to be hanged.
At the first hurdle he manifested pained surprise,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
stopped dead and began to nibble the furze. Blows
and curses brought him to the straw-bound pole, where
he again paused to munch. The gate being uneatable,
however, he cleared it, pecking heavily, broke the trap
into matchwood, and jammed his rider’s knee against
the wall. Then, evincing a sudden passion for the
water, tore up to it <i lang="it">con amore</i>, only to swerve aside at
the wing, leaving Stubbs to go on in the main direction;
and as splash, roar and oath ascended to heaven,
returned to his nibbling.</p>

<p>The Committee appeared on the spot like mushrooms.
Stubbs was fished out, set right end up,
condoled with, and, being close in front of the Grand
Stand, requested to hush. But Stubbs did not hush,
had no intention of hushing. Stamping and shouting,
he informed them what he thought of shows in general
and this show in particular. Then he was requested
to leave, but he wouldn’t do that, either, and by way
of reply ran a coil of lurid language round every
member of the association. Men climbed down from
the stands and joined the happy party, until presently
it seemed as if the whole Agricultural Society was
helping in the suppression and ejection of Stubbs.</p>

<p>Harriet, white to the lips, observed “Rotter!
Low-down rotter!” between her teeth and got to her
feet; but when she would have made her way down,
Hamer caught her by the arm.</p>

<p>“This isn’t your job, my girl!” he said cheerfully,
pressing her back into her seat. “You stick to Dandy
there, and grit your teeth a minute longer. I’ll have
things straightened out in two twos.”</p>

<p>He dropped into the ring with extraordinary lightness,
while his daughter slipped a hand round Harriet’s
unreceptive elbow, by way of conveying sympathy
and keeping her quiet at the same time. Helwise
fussed down to them, dropping things and repeating
the bath-theme <i lang="la">ad lib.</i> The people near began to
discuss hats and servants with feverish politeness,
bringing a faint smile even to the victim’s rigid lips.
The Member stood up and tried to see something at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
back of the stand that wasn’t there, and of course
all the grinders followed his example.</p>

<p>Hamer broke a path through the crush with his own
pleasant directness of purpose. Everybody was trying
to make Stubbs behave, and nobody was succeeding:
neither Bluecaster, tongue-tied and ashamed, nor
Lancaster, soothing and propelling, nor the High
Sheriff, the Chief Constable, the Judges, the Secretary
and Treasurer, the Referee in All Classes, nor the
Police. It was a case of carrying Stubbs off bodily,
and nobody liked to do it, for, in spite of language
and check and abominable conduct, he was yet One
of Us, and moreover his daughter watched from the
stand. To them came Hamer the Outsider.</p>

<p>“Sir,” he observed to Stubbs, with the simple grace
of touch that gave his every action charm, “I understand
you to be an authority upon <i lang="la">Rotifera</i>. I should
like your advice upon the mounting of certain specimens
of <i lang="la">Bdelloidaceæ</i> that I have just obtained!”</p>

<p>Stubbs broke off half-way in a stream of adjectives
beginning with the second and fourth letters of the
alphabet, and stared; and everybody round, after a
momentary impression that Hamer was drunk, too,
wagged their heads and repeated “<i lang="la">Bdelloidaceæ!</i>”
in a loud chorus, as if it were some kind of charm, until
Stubbs himself began to say any bits of it that came
foremost, without in the least meaning to.</p>

<p>“I have also some fine samples of <i lang="la">Pedalionidæ</i>,”
Hamer continued in his comforting tones, motioning
Lancaster to call up his car as he engineered the
offender towards the rope. “A remarkable species—most
remarkable!—but perfectly familiar to you, I’ve
no doubt. The <i lang="la">Flosculariaceæ</i>, too, not to speak of
the <i lang="la">Philodinaceæ</i>—here we are, and mind the step!”</p>

<p>Stubbs made one last attempt to get up steam, but
was throttled with a fresh animalculæ, hustled into the
car and driven off. Lanty came back to the girls.</p>

<p>“I’m to drive you home, if you’ll allow me,” he said
to Dandy; and “Can I find your bicycle?” to Harriet.
“The third round will be through in a few minutes, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
I’ll hand my job over to somebody, and we’ll clear off
at once, if you like. Your man has the horse, so he’s
all right. You’ve done well, to-day, haven’t you?
How many firsts did you get? You and Wild Duck
are bad to beat!”</p>

<p>Harriet grunted, but her face relaxed. It hardened
again, however, as she stood up and took a last defiant
look round before walking off the field. She cycled
home behind the dog-cart, counting the times Lancaster’s
eyes were turned to Dandy’s face. She was
a trifle cheered when it began to rain heavily, and she
was able to hand over the carriage-umbrella with an
air of patronage, and splash along bravely in Burberry
and K.; but, in spite of the “firsts,” in spite of having
been proved infallible, her cup of bitterness, that day,
was full.</p>

<p>Helwise chattered all the way as blithely as if erring
fathers and shamed daughters did not exist. Bluecaster,
it seemed, had promised the bath.</p>

<p>“He was quite agreeable about it, Lancelot—porcelain
on legs, nickel-plated hot and cold, <i>you</i> know! I
really hadn’t to hint more than <i>twice</i>! That led on,
of course, to the Perils to Plumbers—my dear boy,
how often have I told you that I never <i>ask</i>? He’s
sending the cheque to-night. You don’t think, Miss
Shaw, that your charming father——? Really, Lancelot,
you needn’t bite my head off! You’re not a bit
grateful about the bath, and I don’t agree with you
that the old one was all right. I knew I should get
a present to-day, because I put on my skirt wrong side
out. That always means luck! It was rather awkward,
because the wrong side of the stuff doesn’t go
with the coat, and the picoted seams looked rather
queer—I saw people staring, on the stand—but I’m
glad I stuck to it! If I’d changed, I shouldn’t have
got the bath.”</p>

<p>Dandy listened vaguely to the chattering voice,
thinking of her father, happily mounted on his favourite
hobby. He would love looking after Stubbs, and they
would spend the evening forming plans for his regeneration.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
She had a touch of tenderness for the impossible
Stubbs; he had unintentionally given her this blissful
ride in the rain. When Helwise stopped for a second,
she listened to the hoofs and to Lanty’s little clicks
and calls of encouragement. She had heard him define
horse-travelling as “company and music.” She remembered
it now, and had music in her heart to match.
And so, in hearing it, forgot to listen to Helwise altogether.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>And for a whole week the County talked of Hamer,
and went about prating of <i lang="la">Bdelloidaceæ</i> as if they bred
them, and looked up rotiferous information on the
quiet, in order to confound each other’s ignorance.
The wives called at Watters and filled the card-tray,
and the postman staggered under letters of invitation.
Hamer became known as “sound,” “useful,” “a man
at a pinch,” “a dashed good sort all round, don’t you
know!” and every club in the district fought to own
him. He was quite pleased about it all, and never
guessed that his impulsive piece of “tramming” had
worked the transformation. Somebody in a hole
needing pulling out was all that Hamer wanted to make
him happy, and he was seldom out of a job. He
welcomed the new friends as he had welcomed the
grinders and leeches, and opened to them his heart and
his pocket.</p>

<p>That was how Hamer became “county.”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>THE OLD ORDER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Seated</span> at his table in the window of the “Duke,”
Lancaster could see the farmers come jogging into
Sandwath, rounding the dangerous corner with a
loose rein, and, as often as not, a head turned in the
opposite direction. There were few dreary faces among
them, for the late year had been a good one, with heavy
crops and the right sort of weather, and no disease
to play havoc with stock. He watched them disappear
into the stable-yard, and from thence drift across
to the Bank, presently to drift back to the “Duke”
for their receipts. It was the last of the three January
rent-audits, Bluecaster, Witham and Sandwath; the
last, the smallest, and far the most enjoyable. The
others, where the numbers ran in each case to over a
hundred, were too big, too busy, too long; but to-day
there were only the marsh-men and some from nearer
home, including Wild Duck, counting barely forty,
all told. Here, everybody knew his neighbour, and
the tenants were mostly of long holding, so that the
half-yearly meeting was more like a gathering of a
clan than a business convocation. He knew precisely
the time-worn joke that would herald most of them,
together with the equally hoary grievance; just as
he knew the ancient answer that would spring to his
lips of its own accord. He was not bored, even if
he had ceased to be much amused. The years had
not changed the audit into a mere mechanical necessity,
nor stolen one whit of its humanity. These people
were part of himself by now, with their shrewdness
and simpleness, ignorance and intuition, pungent wit,
callous exteriors and sentimental hearts. He had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
key to every one of them, knew how far each was to
be trusted, how far advice would carry, how much
sympathy would be wise. The breaking-up of an old
man hurt him, as did the downfall of a young one;
just as octogenarian vigour or steady success was a
matter of almost personal pride. Scarcely any life
on the land but touched his own somewhere, definitely
or unconsciously working its own effect.</p>

<p>The last three months had passed quickly, and more
happily than any since his father’s death. It seemed
as if, with the settling of the marsh problem, the worry
of years had come to a head and ceased; as if, in
playing the rôle of Fate, he had acquired something
of Fate’s serenity. The old, grinding anxiety had
vanished, leaving in its place a steady, uplifting
consciousness of righteous power.</p>

<p>Outwardly, things were not altered. His employer,
though rushed home for the last three days, was
generally, if not always postally, at least mentally
out of reach. Helwise still hampered him with
her activities, like a child pettishly dragging unwieldly
toys for a walk and expecting the grown-up
to carry them. Harriet’s bicycle still scraped his
walls; the cares of the estate changed only in detail;
the county work still clamoured. But he brought to
it all fresh ardour and a new sense of peace, from what
source he could not have told. Perhaps it was the
new interest over at Watters; perhaps the gathering
of strength from a big decision over-past. Just
possibly it was the long moment of calm wherewith
the gods soothe a man before they strike.</p>

<p>He was at Watters a good deal, nowadays, more often,
indeed, than he realised, unconsciously seeking the
stimulation of Hamer’s vitality and courage. He still
kept his difficulties to himself, after long habit, yet he
often came away finding them solved. Except for his
weakness for leeches, Hamer’s tram-horse philosophy
was founded upon excellent common sense, and had
nothing of Bluecaster’s nervous charity. He saw life
pitifully, but never morbidly, and his remedies were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
for time and not for the moment alone. Lancaster
left him braced not only to work but to feel, and to
be glad of his capacity for both.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he was of use to the older man
in many ways, engineering him over social pitfalls,
along the precipice of tradition and through the network
of county relationship; while to Mrs. Shaw
he was an everlasting support and stay. He knew
the best methods of reconciling modern grates with
ancient hearths; why the newspaper didn’t turn up,
and what was wrong with the milk; how to re-tape
Venetian blinds and bottle fruit, and where to buy
the best blankets and hams; what was a tramp and
what wasn’t; what you might say to your servants,
and what you certainly might not; why it was wrong
to tip the Force, and right to use steamers in apple-tarts;
the neatest way of clearing cockroaches, and
what the Government was going to do.</p>

<p>But with Dandy he seemed to get very little further.
He was often so absorbed that he forgot to speak to
her, though he seldom forgot—unconsciously, perhaps—to
look at her. He knew vaguely that he liked her,
found her presence pleasing, and was grateful for her
kindly acts; and sometimes, in some hour magnetised
by Wiggie’s singing, he turned to her as to the woman
of his dreams. But always he came back doggedly
to his first impression of her in the Lane. She was
not of his world—the world of the soul, where it walks
alone until the silver fingers of its eternal mate make
music on the thrilling door. She did not speak his
language, or love his loves; and sometimes he would
leave the beauty of Watters with a queer relief, to
talk shop with Harriet under a shippon wall.</p>

<p>The latter drove in now, in her smart, new milk-float,
affecting the farmer’s jog-trot which would
soon ruin the brisk little cob he had bought for her,
he reflected, with a shrug. She had Wiggie with her,
and threw him the reins while she made the pilgrimage
from the Bank to the “Duke.” Wiggie knew nothing
about horses, but he would have held a megalosaurus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
if Harriet had commanded, so hung on and murmured
all the horse songs he could think of, from “The Tin
Gee-Gee” to “The Arab’s Farewell to his Favourite
Steed.”</p>

<p>She scowled when Lancaster and the clerk got up
as she entered, and the former offered her a chair.
She resented their reception of her as a lady rather
than as a rent-paying tenant, and her ploughboy manner
was particularly evident upon these occasions. Perhaps,
in spite of her strenuous pose, the pilgrimage, ending
at Lancaster’s table, hurt something of her hidden
woman’s pride. In any case she needed to carry
a high head for Stubbs, who marked the day with a
white stone. He always insisted upon attending
the dinner with Harriet’s ticket, and the result, if
customary, was none the less galling.</p>

<p>She refused the seat, flipping the bank voucher
across the table, and thrusting the estate receipt into
an important-looking pocket-book; then, remembering
her part, sat down sideways and dug her hands
into her pockets.</p>

<p>“What about that pig-hull you promised me?”
she demanded, in a Judge Jeffreys tone that made the
clerk jump.</p>

<p>Lanty temporised solemnly, with the tactful evasiveness
of custom. He knew quite well that she had only
said it to impress his subordinate, because the pig-hull
had been granted at least a week before, but he wouldn’t
for worlds have denied her the traditional privilege
of the punctual tenant, which was in this case no more
than just a little bit of side.</p>

<p>“I see you’ve Wigmore with you,” he added,
looking out to where that unhappy gentleman, to
the tune of “Come, pretty bird, and live with me!”
was trying to persuade the cob that the bar-parlour
of the “Duke” was not the mouth of his private
stable.</p>

<p>“We’ve been to see the Vicar—Bluecaster, I mean—so
I brought him on. The choral has been asked to
oblige with ‘Elijah,’ sometime in March, in aid of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
missions over the seas and kindred objects. Would
you consider Stubbs, half-seas-over, a kindred object?
Wiggie happened to say he knew something about the
music, so I told him he could sing. He hung back
a bit at first, but I wasn’t standing any nonsense.
Mind you turn up with plenty of cash. By the way,
there’s that match with Bortun to-morrow.” (Hockey
understood.) “You’ll be pig-and-whistle as usual,
of course? I’ve got some sort of a team scratched
together, but I’m still short of a centre-half. I expect
I’ll have to play there myself, unless <i>you</i>’ll take it
on?”</p>

<p>“Too old!” Lanty shook his head. “Is Wigmore
training for a circus, by any chance?”</p>

<p>Harriet rose and came to the window, to behold
the cob threading a Ladies’ Chain with half-a-dozen
vehicles at the “Duke’s” kerb. Poor Wiggie, utterly
at its mercy, chirrupped, sang and apologised in a
breath.</p>

<p>“Why not get <i>him</i> to play?” Lancaster added.</p>

<p>“Much use!” Harriet laughed contemptuously.
“<i>He</i> can’t do anything but <i>sing</i>! By the way, he
wants to know if you’ll do him the favour to ask him
to the dinner? I offered him my ticket, but Stubbs
went out and threw bricks at the hens until I withdrew,
so I had to come to you. Dandy wants to know what
it’s like, so of course Wiggie’s ready to break his neck
over it. He’d do anything for her—crawl into the
boiler and come out with the steam!”</p>

<p>She did not look at him—she was too sporting for
that—but she felt as if in herself the sudden twinge
of jealousy that for a moment held him still. Then he
said “Of course!” and handed her the ticket; and
she turned to the door with a rough-and-ready greeting
for the next comer. Lanty’s voice followed her.</p>

<p>“Two o’clock—and you’d better tell him to pass
the punch! It’ll just about finish him if he isn’t
used to that sort of thing, and he doesn’t look over-sturdy.
The atmosphere will be pretty dangerous,
too. You might mention in passing that there’s no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
need to make a martyr of himself. I can tell Miss
Shaw anything she wants to know.”</p>

<p>Harriet said “Right-o!” with a queer smile,
adding,—“you’ll think on about that pig-hull?” for
the benefit of her successor, and went out with the
ticket burning in her pocket. It was Dandy’s ticket
all right, no matter who passed the punch or coughed
in the smoke.</p>

<p>Lanty came back to business haunted by the smile
and an irritating conviction that he had somehow
made a fool of himself. They stayed with him all
morning, marring his real contentment; for it was
pleasant to have no difficult points to tackle after the
good year. Not that the tenants were at pains to
emphasise the luck. On the contrary, scarcely one
of them would own to any special favouring of Providence.
Hay might have done well, but it had been
slow weather, if fine, and that meant labour at an
exorbitant wage. “Why, a man could bare lig his
head on t’pillow fur thinkin’ he sud be out an’ about,
puttin’ the wark through!” Harvest might have been
fair to middlin’, “Ay, but look at t’last two crops!
What, we’ve not pulled up on <i>that</i> lot, yet! It’s one
year wi’ another i’ farmin’, an’ like as not t’bad year’s
t’yan as gits t’job! ’Tisn’t as if crops was all, neyther.
Stock’s gey ticklish stuff to manish, breet as a button
ya minnit, an’ deein’ off like flees t’next. Why,
t’whole countryside knaas what luck I’ve had wi’ my
coves!” And then would follow the usual wheedling
demand for midden-steads, lime, shippon-repairs in
their degree, or anything else that “Mr. Lancaster, sir”
looked good for. It was all part of the game, and there
was little goodwill going missing as they came and went
in the wintry sun. What bitter struggle the past
could show, what grinding fear the future might hold,
were alike forgotten as they stood about in little groups,
weather-beaten faces and ageing backs, ready to enjoy
their pillgill now that the pang of “parting” was over;
for though the Westmorland farmer must have a
grievance even at the wonder-point of prosperity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
he must also, on the very verge of ruin, crack his
joke.</p>

<p>Brack’s beautiful entry in the S.-F.—an elaborate
<span class="sans">S</span> bend round his Uncle Holliday and old Simon Farrer,
violently exchanging views in the middle of the road—was
spoilt by a large mangold at the end of a rope,
attached to his back axle by Denny, somewhere <i lang="fr">en
route</i>. The mangold, not being accomplished in
<span class="sans">S</span> bends, knocked Simon’s feet from under him and
caught Uncle Willie on the knee; and while they were
busy asking Brack what he meant by it, Denny himself
ramped in with his high-stepper and the expression
of a lily-white hen.</p>

<p>Taken altogether, it was a gay enough morning
but for one solitary episode, when Wolf came in for
the last time as tenant of Ninekyrkes. The little
interview was one of those that Fate stamps with a
fiery thumb.</p>

<p>He drove in alone, acknowledging no greeting,
and, when some one came forward to take his horse,
climbing down without a word. It seemed a long
time before he came out of the Bank, and when at
last he crossed the road it was with bitter reluctance,
his head bent, ignoring salutation and outstretched
hand.</p>

<p>Lanty met him as cheerfully as he could with his
usual—“Well, Wolf, how’s yourself?” but the time-hallowed
reply—“A long way on to ploughin’ over
Jordan!” drew but a ghost of the old smile from both;
and when business was through with, the shaky old
figure still sat in the chair, saying nothing and staring
at the floor. Lancaster made a movement with his
hand, and the clerk got up and went out. The agent
waited, sorry and patient.</p>

<p>“How’s your missis?” he asked at last, when the
silence grew unbearable, trying to keep the same brisk,
commonplace tone. Wolf raised his eyes.</p>

<p>“She’s a deal better, thank you kindly, sir. She’s
not like the same woman since things was fixed. She
never fashes herself over the water, nowadays. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
can’t rightly make her out, though—but it’s no matter.
It’ll not be for long.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be getting into the Pride soon, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Ay. In a few weeks.”</p>

<p>“You’ll not think better of it?”</p>

<p>“Yon’s over an’ by with, sir. I reckon we can
let it bide.”</p>

<p>Lancaster nodded, and there was a second silence.
Wolf sat still, as if unable to make the move which
would mean the end of all the former things. Unspoken,
between them was the memory of many other days
when he had sat thus, first with the father, and later
with the son. Reminiscences surged upward of kindnesses
on either side, of mutual sympathy and encouragement.
There had been bad years when the
farmer had needed help, but on the other hand the
agent had had in return many a piece of rough advice,
worth its weight in gold. Looking back to his early
struggle, Lancaster knew that, both to Michael’s tolerant
handling of a problem and Wolf’s fierce cutting at
the root, he had owed much. And Wolf was a link
between himself and his father. The younger men,
even loyal partisans like Denny, did not count the
same. Again, as months before in his own office,
he felt old, seeing the strong man of his father’s time
tottering on the last steep slope. This was the end
of Wolf’s real life, whether he went to his grave a
year later or ten. The situation wrung his heart,
fretting him with his own helplessness. He could
do nothing except attempt, by some recurring instinct,
to turn him from the one last boon he craved.</p>

<p>They sat on while the clerk, kicking his heels on
the mat, wondered at the silence. This was their
real good-bye, without thanks or spoken sorrow, the
last speechless God-be-with-you! of two troubled
men of the North.</p>

<p>The clerk’s attention was distracted by a dog in
the bar-parlour—a dog that had a fluffy-haired damsel
as background—and into the death-chamber of a passing
relationship Brack stepped, unchecked. Looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
up, Lanty saw him at the door, running his curious
eyes over the pair at the table. In spite of what came
after, he never in all his life quite forgave Brack for
his intrusion at that moment.</p>

<p>Wolf pulled himself up, and was for leaving with
the usual unemotional jerk, but Lanty stood up, too,
and held out his hand. Still, neither said anything,
until the old man, going, spoke up suddenly, playing
the game to the last, even as Harriet had tried to play
it, posing to hide a wounded heart.</p>

<p>“Yon fodder-gang, sir, as I mentioned? The old
one’s as near done as may be. You’ll happen think
it over——?” He broke off then, reality gripping him,
and Lanty, biting his lip, said “I’ll see to it, Wolf!”
and turned to the window. Brack laughed callously
as the door closed.</p>

<p>“What’s the old boy so almighty stuck about? He’s
through with Ninekyrkes to-day, isn’t he? Mighty
sick, I should say, and feeling kind of ‘’Way down upon
the Swanee River’! A bit lost, too, from his talk.
He’ll want precious little with fodder-gangs out at the
Pride!”</p>

<p>Lancaster said—“Grand weather for the time of
year,” and handed him his receipt. The eyes of the
two men met, Brack’s in a smiling half-sneer; and
then he said “Champ!” turning, still smiling, to
leave.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to hustle you with ‘wants,’” he
added kindly, “though I guess that doesn’t mean there’s
nothing to ask! I reckon the only thing that would
mend Thweng is a keg of gunpowder. But I’d just
like to warn you to keep your boots well strutted.
There’ll be powerful cold feet for somebody in March!”</p>

<p>He swung out with his insolent smile, the last word
successfully arresting an impulse that would have sent
him spinning into the road. “March!” So Brack
had evidently been behind Ezekiel, as conjectured.
But why March? What was at the back of it all?
And what did he think was coming?</p>

<p>Denny burst in just afterwards and dispelled his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
wonderings, full of joy about the mangold, and anxious
to know if Mr. Lancaster had seen it. His rollicking
vitality swept the air clean both of regret and apprehension,
so that, by the time Lanty took his seat at
dinner, the surprising touch of jealousy evoked by
Wiggie’s request was his only aftermath of the morning.</p>

<p>The singer was on his left, with a very well-brushed
Stubbs beside him, and Michael Dockeray opposite.
At the head, Bluecaster, not quite certain that he
wasn’t still in Cairo, had Willie Holliday, as chief
tenant, on one hand, and Wolf on the other. The last
was Dockeray’s place by right, but Bluecaster had
contrived to remember the special circumstances
and to whisper a word in Michael’s ear. The right
waived, he called to Wolf, and the little attention
brightened the old man considerably. It was by acts
like these that Bluecaster kept his hold on his people
in spite of his long absences. His larger generosity
came to them, tempered by reason, through his agent,
but his little touches of consideration had the charm
of personal courtesy, and were thereby kept in mind.
Lancaster was the strong arm upon which they leaned,
but his lordship had his own place in their hearts.</p>

<p>Wiggie had a bad time with the enormous meal,
but while he tried to disguise his primary plate of
beef as turkey and various other dishes, his mind was
busy with his surroundings. He knew that he had
before him an ancient system working at its best
under the most ideal conditions, a triangular relationship
which needed the right men in each department
to keep the bearings smooth. Just such a state of
things might never come his way again. Men said
the system was getting played out, becoming extinct
as the dodo; but here at least it seemed as if change,
however well-intentioned, could mean little but disintegration.
The fascination of that most claiming
of problems, the interdependence of human beings,
not only for things of the body but of the spirit, took
him as he looked round the ring of faces, after staving
off a too-attentive plum-pudding. The townsman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
knew many employers of labour, men of large hearts
and high standards, who had their thousands at a
nod in the morning, and could play “smack-at-back-o’-t’lug”
with them of an evening without the faintest
troubling of authority. But here was something
altogether different, reaching back into far years that
had, even then, given each man present his place.
Here were ease and understanding, but no forcing of
either. The invisible silken strings between the three
elements yielded this way and that to the need of
the moment, but readjusted themselves immediately.
You could shake hands across them, hail flesh and
blood on the other side and hear the beating of good
human hearts, but you could not climb them. They
were always there, stretched by long custom and spun
on many graves.</p>

<p>Brack alone was out of place, with his over-smart
good looks and jarring mannerisms. If he could not
scale the strings he could snip them, and you heard
the click of the scissors. Even Stubbs, already well
on the way to becoming a “kindred object,” and talking
as broad Westmorland as anybody present, was
to be preferred to Brack. Later, however, he began
to get really warmed-up and quarrelsome, and it
took pounds of Rotifer Magic to keep him quiet.
Wiggie had spent the whole of the previous evening
with a weary eye glued to the microscope, so that he
was in a position to be fluent, and if he made bad breaks
at times, the kindred object was not in a condition
to point them out. Wiggie had a knack of acquiring
information that was of no earthly use to himself, but
smoothed the way for other people; and if the opportunity
did not always turn up immediately, that did
not prevent him getting ready for it. Sitting on stiles
waiting for lame dogs was constitutional with Wiggie.</p>

<p>He had early found his way into Lancaster’s good
graces, so that he was rather troubled by his touch of
stiffness at the beginning of the meal. He thawed him,
however, with one of his quaint questions, and Lancaster
soon found himself pointing out characters and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
fixing labels, supplying histories and opening his
treasury of tales. He forgot that “Dandy wants to
know” was the driving-power behind Wigmore’s
interest, remembering only that he was being given a
clear run for the hobby of his heart.</p>

<p>“You know my neighbour here, I suppose—Mr.
Dockeray of Ladyford? Oh, well, he’s a pillar of
the county—Justice of the Peace, R.D.C., Guardian,
etc., so we have to behave ourselves at this end of
the room! Mr. Wigmore’s stopping at Watters,
Michael—you’ve met Mr. Shaw, of course. Brought
him over one day, didn’t I? Michael’s going
to give us a song, after a bit. By the way, I hope
you’ll be kind enough to do something in that line,
too. We fancy our singing here, but I don’t exactly
imagine we’ve anything to beat you! Brack Holliday?—yes—that’s
the man you gave a lesson in
carburettors in the middle of Leighton Mosses. He
offered you a cigarette—one of his Turks—and you
took it just to oblige him and coughed for ten minutes
after he’d cleared out. How do I know? Because
I was on the far side of the hedge, working out valuations,
and I was pressed for time, or I’d have come
over and held your hand or patted you on the back.
The shy, thin man between the big cattle-dealer and
Belt-End Gibson is Bownass of Moss End. He’s
one of your musical people. Been in Sandwath Church
choir for years and years, and can’t read a part to
save his life. Best ploughman in the district, too—barring,
perhaps, Lup Whinnerah, but Lup doesn’t
count now, worse luck! You must come to a ploughing-match,
one of these days. They’re a bit tedious,
though, if you’re a stranger. The masters curse them
like anything, beforehand, because the men are so keen
practising that they plough like snails, stopping all
the time to look behind and admire. It’s a slow job
anyway, of course. Still, Miss Shaw might like to know.”</p>

<p>He couldn’t resist the sentence, and saw the blood
rise in Wiggie’s face. Rather ashamed, he went on
hurriedly—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>“That’s Thomas Cuthbert Dennison with the
twinkle. He’s asking Brack if he means to start
classes for restoring respiration. Brack thinks they’re
all going to be drowned on the marsh, you know, and
Denny wants to be in practice. He’s a great chap!
Bit too fond of a joke, that’s all. Did you see the
mangold? No? Well, that cob <i>does</i> take a bit of
holding!” He met Wigmore’s eye in polite sympathy,
and they both laughed.</p>

<p>“There’s a tale against Denny that never quite
goes out of fashion. When he was a lad he was out
with a pretty cousin from Lancaster. After a long
while of saying nothing at all, he gives a great sigh.
‘Why, whatever’s the matter?’ says the cousin,
alarmed. ‘Nay, I was nobbut thinking,’ says Denny,
very dismal. Well, then, the cousin offers him a penny
for his thoughts, but Denny was terribly shy-like,
and wouldn’t out with them. ‘Eh, well,’ he says at
last, ‘I was just thinking as I’d never furgit this here
walk with thee!’ Cousin fluttered, of course. ‘Why,
I’m sure you’re very kind, but you sound terribly
serious about it!’ ‘Ay,’ says Denny, ‘I reckon I is.
I’se gitten on a paar o’ Brother Steve’s boots, an’ they’ve
scratted aw t’ skin off my heels!’ I say—can’t you
smother Knewstubb with another microbe or two?”</p>

<p>(The boot story made him think of Brack’s parting
speech. He wondered what had brought the tale
to mind.)</p>

<p>“Yes, Denny’s a laddie! He’s framed a bit differently
with the lasses, since then! But he’s a right
good sort, taken all round. His lordship’s making
ready for the Loyal Toast, so you’d better be getting
something into that glass of yours. You don’t happen
to be a parson, do you? That’s all right—we can
skip the Bishop and Clergy and get ahead. There’ll
be a deuce of a smoke before long—do you think you
ought to sing in it? If you find you can’t stick it,
there’s a door here, just behind my chair.”</p>

<p>And Wiggie nodded his head gratefully, and began
to repeat a mental list as long as the Shorter Catechism,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
beginning with beef and mutton and silken threads
and mangolds and ploughing-matches, and ending
with Brother Steve’s boots.</p>

<p>After that, the business of the evening began. The
cloths cleared, and dessert on the table, together with
the long, white churchwardens, Bluecaster rose to
propose “The King!” This having been honoured
with fervour, the hands went out to the pipes, and Uncle
Willie got to his feet to have his say about the landlord.
You could see Bluecaster wriggle until his health was
safely through the wine, and the cheers and musical
honours safely off the feudal chest. His speech in
reply was a mixture of Cairo and crops, recognition,
New Year wishes and shy little jokes, haltingly
delivered, but it was well intended and very well
received; and always the hint of breeding crept out
in some graceful thought, however poorly spoken,—regret
for a sick man’s absence, sympathy in bereavement,
congratulation upon some particular success.
Towards the end, he stumbled and stuck with half
a sentence on his lips, and Lancaster knew that he
wanted to say something about the Whinnerahs, but
he was barely through the introductory words before the
old man reached out a hand, begging: “Don’t, my lord!
Don’t now!” and the master huddled up his speech in
a last blanket of acknowledgment and sat down.</p>

<p>Michael had the agent’s health in trust, and when
Lancaster stood up to answer, the faces grew interested,
for his was the only serious speech of the evening. He
looked at Wiggie first, though, firmly taking from him
the pipe with which he was meekly struggling. He
jerked his head towards the door.</p>

<p>“This is going to be dull, so clear off out for a breath
of fresh air, and stop putting chimneys down that
precious throat of yours. It’s going to be dull, I tell
you, and I ought to know! You’re not missing
anything. As for Miss Shaw, she can read it in the
papers, if she wants!”</p>

<p>That sent the faithful Wiggie flying, as he expected,
to cool his aching head in the drawing-in afternoon;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
and with the tail of his eye on Stubbs and his behaviour,
Lancaster got to work.</p>

<p>His speech was technical, concentrated, rigidly
pinned down to the main interest, but dull it was not,
so clearly did the plain words round and emphasise
each situation, salting hard facts with the short, dry
wit that stimulates the Northerner like his own first
frosts. Drifting outside to an uncurtained window,
Wiggie was fascinated by the picture within. Through
the mist of smoke he saw the faces at the table turned
with the stillness of complete attention to the forceful
figure at the end. Lancaster was at his best when
speaking. The whole man braced and strengthened,
and the almost dour look, so often seen in those who
come early into big responsibilities, relaxed as some
apt finish sent a slow ripple round the ring, setting
its final seal on his own mouth. There came to Wigmore,
of the town, a sense of the wide qualifications
that go to the making of the ideal steward. A well-known
member of this “easy” profession has said
that the land agent must be “a keen judge of character,
of a genial and sympathetic disposition and energetic
nature, must know when to be firm, when yielding, the
many times when he must lead, the few when he must
drive, whom to trust and whom to suspect, what to
notice and what to ignore, where to command and where
merely to suggest, whom to praise and whom censure.
Forethought, vigilance, courtesy, reticence are qualities
which will carry him far.... He has duties to perform
on behalf of tenants as well as landlord. He is a human
buffer between his employer and the farmers, and must
shield the former from annoyance, and uphold the just
claims of the latter, even to the sacrifice of his own
popularity. He must be as reticent as the lawyer, as
upright as the parson, as firm as the policeman. He
must be well informed on every subject, whether it
be Bradshaw or the debenture stocks of a company—the
pedigree of a cow or that of a peer; the price of
a Scotch moor, or the vintage of a claret.”</p>

<p>The “easy” profession carries with it the immense
penalty of an influence reaching forward into the future<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
long after death, in a fashion characteristic of scarcely
any other. There are some of us whose chief honour
and glory is to find men of humble station still appraising
right and wrong by the standards taught them of
our fathers.</p>

<p>Wiggie’s eye ran along the dark heads etched on the
yellow light, from Stubbs, somnolently fixing Lanty
to the punctuation of a spasmodic “Hear, hear!”
to Dockeray, thoughtful and quiet, Brack, supercilious
but attentive, Wolf, quiveringly interested and yet
outside, and finally to Bluecaster in his big chair at
the head. He wondered afterwards why, of all the
tragedies at the table—and there was more than one
plain to the eye—Bluecaster’s had seemed to him the
most helpless and complete. There is something
terrible in the relentlessness with which inheritance
may force a man into a position he is not framed to
fill, thrusting power into his hands and judgment
into his mouth whether he desire their fiery splendours
or no. He may, of course, pluck the joys of heritage
and leave its duties to look after themselves; but if
he has good blood behind him and a strong hand
beside him, he will come to them, soon or late. Left
to himself, with no great name to support, Bluecaster
would have been a tennis champion or somebody’s
private skipper, chauffeur or huntsman—anything
but the head of a large estate, with his generous but
harassed brain besieged by the growing problems of
the day. Yet he had hurried home from Egypt to
take his place, to speak the right word as far as he
knew, and was sitting with his patient dog’s eyes raised
in courteous attention, keeping his end up not too unsuccessfully,
thanks to the spur of race and the steady
influence of a good servant.</p>

<p>Lancaster finished the survey of the half-year,
covering general events, agricultural conditions and
the new legislation; and then, on an impulse that he
never ceased to regret, referred, in his final sentences,
to a subject already closed.</p>

<p>“I should just like to add that I hope all the marsh-men
are sleeping well!” he ended, dropping into a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
lighter tone. “Mr. Bracken Holliday was a little
anxious, as we all know, about the beginning of last
autumn, but I trust that by now he has come round
to the general conclusion of safety.” He lifted his
glass. “I wish all on the marsh a succession of
prosperous seasons and no dreams!”</p>

<p>Denny seized this excellent opportunity for sending
round a cardboard nautical imitation labelled “The
Thweng Life-Boat,” and quite a number of pence was
jangled down in front of Brack. He nodded careless
thanks, but he whitened angrily, and he sent one long
glance up the table which set Lancaster biting his lip.
The farmer said nothing, however, and his lordship,
grateful that the difficult subject was not to be re-opened,
muttered—“Bounder got some decent feeling,
after all!” and handed him his own cigarette-case.
Brack coloured, this time, and fell into frowning
thought. The courtesy got home, even through his
armour of conceit, but vaguely he groped for subtler
sympathy behind. Who knew what Bluecaster really
thought about the Lugg?</p>

<p>Denny was asked to respond for “The Bonny
Lasses of Westmorland,” and did so with enthusiasm,
quite unabashed by pointed interrogations, such as:
“Wha was fust-footer ower to Braithet’s?” (Braithwaite
had a crowd of pretty daughters) and, “Wha’s
buits bed ta gitten fur t’job?” etc., etc. Michael
opened the singing in the gentle, light tenor that he
raised every Sunday in the Ladyford family pew
where his fathers had worshipped. The song was the
inevitable “Kind Mary,” and Lanty wondered whether
he was thinking of his own cheerful, masterful partner
as he sang with his mild eyes fixed on the ceiling,
marking the rhythm with slow nods. Denny gave them
the famous “Eh, poor Lassie, she was Dumb!” and
called upon Brack to oblige with “Pull for the Shore,
Sailor!” or “Throw out the Life-Line!” but his
victim, placated by the cigarette-case, was not to be
drawn. Old Simon contributed “The Mardale Hunt,”
hammering out the time with the punch-ladle, and
quaveringly commanding the chorus to “give it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
weft!” Lanty always sang the same song, his
father’s song: “In the Downhill of Life.” Wigmore,
drawn gradually back by the music, stood presently
in the doorway, listening to the simple faith of an older
generation—</p>

<p>Stubbs wished to supplement this with “Riding
down to Bangor,” but was firmly suppressed, and Wiggie
was called in to keep him in order and supply his
share of the entertainment.</p>

<p>“It’s fearful cheek to ask you!” Lancaster apologised,
“but they don’t know what a big favour it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
is, and they’ll like it no end. You might just give us
something to send us home happy, if you’re not afraid
of your voice.”</p>

<p>“I’ll sing with pleasure!” Wiggie said contentedly,
standing up beside Lancaster’s chair with the same
childlike detachment that he showed on a public
platform. He did not begin at once, though, because
he found the last song very difficult to follow, but after
a moment or two he gave them “The Song of Good
Heart” in a half-whisper sweet as mountain church-bells,
more as if he were thinking it than singing it.</p>

<p>And after that he sang a grand old German “Alleluja!”
letting out his magnificent power until the room
echoed, and his audience thrilled and rocked, intoxicated
with enthusiasm, mightily growling out the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
Royal Salute in various keys of their own, as Wiggie
swept them away to the Table of the Great Rent-Auditor
of All. The voice beat at Lancaster’s brain,
dragging at a lost memory. Wigmore was a bit of a
puzzle all round. He had no relations that one ever
heard of, and no home. He was a professional singer,
yet one never seemed to come across his name, in spite
of his undeniable gift. Perhaps he was one of the unlucky,
to whom no roads open. Certainly there was
little of the blatantly successful artist about his slight,
tired figure and unassuming manner. Yet it was
surely genius that was swinging them all out of their
narrow anchorages on that flood of sound. And only
Brack, suddenly fearful and cold, felt the irony of
that “Alleluja!” on the marshmen’s lips, singing
their Easter anthem before ever the agony and the
grave were passed.</p>

<p>They fell upon Wiggie in a body after that, and
clumped him heavily on the back until he gasped, and
told him it was “champion” and “reet as a bobbin,”
and “fit to beat Holliday’s Royal bull!” until Bluecaster
had to rescue him by giving the final toast, “To
our next merry meeting!” drunk by Brack with shaking
lips. Old Simon presented an unsolicited testimonial.</p>

<p>“There’s them as <i>can</i> sing an’ <i>waint</i> sing!” he pronounced
emphatically, with a scathing eye on Brack,
“an’ the de’il tak’ ’em fur a lock o’ snirpin’ dew-nowts!
An’ theer’s them as <i>can’t</i> sing an’ <i>dew</i> sing—an’
neea thanks tull them, neyther—but niver did I
hear the likes o’ yon!”</p>

<p>Lanty shook the singer by the hand, and said,
“Miss Shaw will be pleased to hear of <i>this</i>, anyhow!”
with nothing in his voice but the heartiest liking, and
Wiggie met it instantly. There was never again
between them a shadow of any kind.</p>

<p>At the door, Harriet waited in the float. It was
already dark. The short January day was over, and
as Wiggie shoved Stubbs up the step, he was glad
that he could not see her face. A moment later,
gathering that the kindred object was already fast
asleep, he asked for a lift home, but Harriet suspected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
him and snapped refusal. “It’s a long way to walk!”
he remonstrated sadly, and so convincingly that she
yielded, thinking he meant to try. Holding on to
Stubbs as they trotted steadily through the dark, he
asked suddenly why she had come herself instead of
sending the man.</p>

<p>“Because this is <i>my</i> job, in spite of Hamer!” she
answered abruptly. “I’ve got to see Stubbs through,
whatever he does. He’s only a poor exhibit as a
father, but he’s all I’m likely to have, and if he
chooses to drink himself to death it’s up to me to
stand the racket.” She pulled into the hedge. “Isn’t
that the Watters car?”</p>

<p>“It’s so difficult to tell, at night,” the subtle Wiggie
made innocent reply, all the time knowing the note of
it as well as the sound of his own voice. But what he
did not know was that, inside it, was Dandy, come to
fetch him in an idle moment. That disappointment
had yet to be revealed. Thus is the spilt wine of our
good deeds made bitter as waters of Marah.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Lup walked over to drive the old man home. Lancaster
had a word with him on the kerb.</p>

<p>“You might have given us a look-in, for the last
time! When next January comes round, you’ll be
feeling sorry you didn’t. When do you leave?”</p>

<p>“In another few weeks, sir. I’ll be stopping a
while with an uncle in Liverpool before sailing. I’d
meant to go, if I’d had to work my passage, but the
old man’s seen to the brass. There’ll be plenty to
start me on the other side an’ all. When he’d once
given in, he wasn’t for stinting me. He’s hard, but he’s
not unjust, and he knows I’ve earned it all right.”</p>

<p>“It’s <i>you</i> that’s hard, Lup—ay, and unjust, too!
You haven’t earned the right to spoil your father’s
last days.”</p>

<p>“He’s had his life, sir. This is mine.”</p>

<p>“And much good may it do you! You’re a fool!”
Lanty swung on his heel to find the Watters chauffeur
at his elbow, wearing such a shocked expression that
both the other men smiled. Lup said, “Like enough!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
Good-night to you, sir!” and rattled off, and Lancaster
drifted to the car. Dandy put out a hand to him
through the window.</p>

<p>“Whom were you slanging on the pavement? And
do you know what has happened to Wiggie? They
have it inside that he’s gone home already.”</p>

<p>It was explained that he had driven off with Mr.
and Miss Knewstubb, and she lifted her eyebrows a
little. She was so used to Wiggie’s devotion that the
wind blew cold at the slightest sign of defection.</p>

<p>“It’s quite all right, of course, but we’d promised
to send over. I had nothing particular to do, so I just
came for the run. I hope he won’t get cold after the
hot room—I brought the closed car on purpose—especially
as he came to please me.”</p>

<p>“He pleased a good many other people, too,” Lanty
said warmly. “He was immense! I can’t think
why he isn’t in the front rank of English singers.
Surely somebody ought to have found him out!”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s getting on all right,” she answered, rather
hurriedly. “I’m sure he enjoyed singing for you.”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, I think he did. He was great, anyhow!
I’m glad you thought of sending him as your representative.”</p>

<p>“I was interested.” She looked down, so that her
head with its halo of yellow light was thrown into
relief by the night and her dark furs. There were
yellow chrysanthemums opposite.</p>

<p>He laughed with a shade of incredulity.</p>

<p>“We’re dull enough at close quarters—just a lot
of rough working-men digging up God’s gold out of the
land. I’d an idea you didn’t approve of us; thought
we starved our dogs or something!” There came to him
a recollection of the last meeting in the Lane. “You
told me once you were home-sick for a collection of
oddments of some sort—Tantalums, Thermos flasks
and hair-curlers!”</p>

<p>It was she who laughed now, and so infectiously
that Bluecaster, making for his carriage, stopped and
asked to be introduced.</p>

<p>“I didn’t include <i>him</i> in my estimate,” Lanty added,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
when he had passed on, leaving a word for Hamer,
and a message of sympathy for Helwise, struggling
with a cold. “He’s different from the rest of us—you’d
know it on the top of Skiddaw. <i>He</i>’s never done any
digging, and I don’t want him to.”</p>

<p>“Digging might be good for him,” Dandy ventured,
and was growled at for her pains.</p>

<p>“No, it wouldn’t! It might alter him, that’s all,
but he’d lose all the other things. He’s the best chap
in Britain! We’re here to do the digging for him, as
we’ve always been. You don’t understand. They
mean a lot to us—the little thoughtfulnesses and the
bottles of cough-medicine and the words in season.
If Bluecaster was digging, he’d be too busy to bother.
That’s what <i>he</i>’s here for. But of course it can’t mean
anything to you.”</p>

<p>“You’re rather rude, I think!” she replied gently,
with a kind of humorous resignation at which he
smiled in spite of himself. Up the street, on the green,
a group of caravans was stationed, the lights of a
merry-go-round filling the winter evening with colour.
A rollicking tune came down to them, mixed with the
shouts and laughter of the crowd.</p>

<p>“Come out and have a look!” he suggested, opening
the door and offering a hand, and presently they were
standing in the ring of light, caught in the deafening
blare of the full orchestrion overhead. Some of the
farmers had stayed for a final flourish to the day’s
festivity. Denny was mounted on a tiger, with his
brother’s little girl in front of him, and one of Braithwaite’s
pleasing daughters behind. The big cattle-dealer
was perched on an inadequate ostrich, with a
scared wife clinging to the neck of a giraffe. The shy
ploughman rode solemnly alone in the red-plush sumptuousness
of a car. The blaze of brightness scooped
out of the pressing dark gave the whole scene a curiously
unreal effect, so that, watching the mechanical rise
and fall of the flying circle, Lanty’s mind, reacting from
the strain of the three days’ audit, grew gradually
quiescent and dazed. Dandy spoke to him, but he
did not hear her. Close at hand in the crowd, Brack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
had turned to face him, but he did not see him. The
lights dimmed suddenly, became lanterns swinging
and dipping in a night as dark as hell. The blare
of the trumpets was the shattering roar of a big wind
as it tore the air to tatters, and the wailing of the reeds
grew into the shrieks of women and the thin crying
of lambs. He was conscious of intense, paralysing
fear, of a frantic necessity to shout, choked on his lips
by the pressure of the gale. And through it all he
felt that he was listening, straining his ears to madness
against the tumult of an inferno let loose, just as,
at Ninekyrkes, he had seen an old woman strain and
reach through the tense stillness of coming thunder.
The deadly helplessness of nightmare weighed him
down as he writhed against the horror, certain that,
if he could speak <i>now</i>, hear <i>now</i>, the unthinkable
danger would pass. Through the torture a hand came
up on to his, a hand that he had never touched before
to recognise, but which held and drew him up and out
of the abyss. He thought vaguely that it must be
Hamer’s—the clasp had the same comfort—but when
he had struggled blindly back to the present, he found
it was not Hamer’s, but his daughter’s. He saw Brack,
then, his eyes, as they rested on him, unnaturally
brilliant, the pupils unnaturally large, before he dropped
his still swaying gaze to Dandy’s face.</p>

<p>“What was it?” he asked. “I heard—water!”
and as he said it he caught a little click in a man’s
throat, as of satisfaction and justification, but when
he looked again, Brack was gone. Dandy drew him
out of the crowd.</p>

<p>“You looked as if you had gone blind!” she said.
“I was frightened, and you trembled as if you were
frightened, too. And you called first to your own father
and then to mine, just as though you were drowning
and wanted help. I expect you’re tired out, and ought
to rest. Let me take you home in the car. You can
send over for your horse to-morrow.”</p>

<p>But he refused. He wanted the quiet ride home
in the night for thought.</p>

<p>“Jogging along in the air will do me good—thanks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
all the same! I <i>am</i> tired—you’re right, there—but
I’m as strong as an ox and can stand anything. I
don’t usually behave like this, even after a rent-audit!
I’m dreadfully sorry if I upset you. I expect the glare
of the lights hypnotised me on top of the landlord’s
punch! You won’t trust yourself to me again, if
I’m going to see visions in your company.”</p>

<p>She gave him her hand a second time through the
window, and he looked down at it in his own. “It
<i>is</i> like Hamer’s!” he said curiously, marking the
resemblance in miniature, small, but square and strong.
She withdrew it with a shade of embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, but what made you think of it, now?
I’m proud of it—dear old Dad! You’ll start at once,
won’t you?—and do keep your wits about you on that
lonely road!”</p>

<p>At the top of the hill he pulled up for a last look down
into the little blaze of life below him, throwing its
brilliance over the pile of the church and the looming
canopies of the trees. The lights still circled madly,
the music still crashed, but they had no power over him,
now. What was it that had used them to the forcing
of that terrible moment? Vague words of Brack’s
about clairvoyance drifted back into his mind. He
had laughed with Bluecaster over a mental picture of
Brack evoking spirits. Was he responsible for that
tortured nightmare? Perhaps he had really been
trying to tell him something; or was it just hypnotic
reaction from that theory of his, obsessing him to madness?
For himself, he could do nothing, now. Even
if he had believed it, he could not doom the Lugg on the
strength of a prophecy—after a rent-dinner, too! And
he did not believe it. His faith stayed where it was.</p>

<p>He quickened his horse along the silent highway,
the healing of the night gathering him into quiet;
and, as he rode, there went with him the pressure of
the hand that was so like Hamer’s, cool and firm and
blessedly kind.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>THE BEGINNING OF THE END</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a very dreamlike day on which Lup left
Ninekyrkes, turning his back upon the marsh and all
that had filled his life hitherto. He made no round of
good-byes, no flurry of preparation, but when the time
came, he went, just as he would go at the end of his
day on a further journey yet. He would “bide still
and die light,” as taught the unhurrying philosophy of
Wiggie’s song.</p>

<p>Not even for Francey had he a farewell; yet she had
her moment with him, all unknown. Lifting her
blind in the first showing of dawn, she saw him standing
on the sea-wall, looking over the bay. He was still
in his rough clothes, and the dull shade of the worn
stuff was one with the colourless growth of the breaking
day. He stood perfectly still, his hands dropped at
his sides, his head a little bent, more like a symbol than
a breathing human. On either side of him a shadowy
wraith of a sheepdog lay crouched with pricked ears,
as if watching for an invisible flock to come shouldering
out of the dim space beneath. They had scarcely left
him a moment during the last few days, clinging like
burrs, and all the last night they had whimpered and
wept, until in desperation he rose and called them out.
Francey knelt at the window with her black hair
looped on either side of her pale face, and saw the day
come up to the feet of her parting love.</p>

<p>He was going, and by a finger she could have held
him, but something kept her back that did not seem
part of her at all. If she had but known it, the tragedy
that was coming was in her hands to force or to withhold;
but she did not know. The question was still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
purely personal, still hung on the one point, whether or
not her real happiness lay in the primitive figure on the
bank. There were tears in her eyes as she thought of
the coming dawns when she might look to find him
there and all in vain, but she was prepared to shed
them. He would leave desolation behind him, but it
would pass. She knew that she was able to let him
go, and while she realised that she would not keep
him.</p>

<p>Yet she longed for a last look, however far, and from
her post under the lifted sash she tried to will that he
should turn and send his climbing glance over the house
to her window, as he had done so many times before,
but her fixed gaze did not reach him. Brack would
have answered it, she knew—Brack, sensitive, impressionable,
ultra-self-conscious; but Lup looked straight
before him with his tranquil eyes, and all the hysterical
telepathy in the world might have shrieked in his ear
and found him deaf. And just for that, just because
he did not look, nor heed, nor answer, Francey felt
wounded and full of longing; for it is always the man
that turns his back that pulls at a woman’s heart.</p>

<p>There was a clink of milk-pails on the stone floor
beneath, followed by steps on the stairs; and then the
door opened, and her mother stood at her shoulder.</p>

<p>“You’ll get your death at yon window! For the
land’s sake don’t be staring at nowt, like poor Martha
at Ninekyrkes! She fair gives me the creeps. It’s
about time to be stirring. I’ve been down a bit, and
t’ master’s out an’ about. Yon’s Lup, I reckon.
What’s he at? Feeling a bit down in the mouth,
likely, but he’ll get over it. Westmorland folk be gey
ill to shift, but they do rarely when they get going.
Lup’ll be a sight better for a change. Canada’ll
happen make a man of him—same as Brack!”</p>

<p>Francey said nothing, watching the pale day grow
round the figure on the wall. The mother kept her
light tone, but her unslept eyes were red.</p>

<p>“It isn’t as if he hadn’t a bit of brass. Wolf’s not
the sort to send him off with his thumb in his mouth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
for all his jye looks! He’s doing well by the lad, and
Lup’ll be fit to do his best back again. What, I
shouldn’t wonder if he’s home in a two-three year, as
like Brack as one pea to another! It’s a sad pity
Brack didn’t hold on till Ninekyrkes was empty. It
would have been pleasant-like, having him next door.”</p>

<p>“Brack at Ninekyrkes!” Francey fired contemptuously.
“Why, mother, he knows nothing of farming!
You should hear the tales going about him. You
should see his fences and his thistles! Mr. Lancaster
will be having a word with him, if he doesn’t mend. He
knows less about crops than I do, and I can handle a
rake with him, any day!”</p>

<p>“Why, there’s nowt to that! Brack’s got a snack
o’ yon culture you reckon so much on. He can handle
that puffin’ billy o’ his, anyhow, an’ carry a smart
coat an’ finger the banjo. Yon was a rare good tune
he give us, t’other night at Sunflatts, with his face
blacked an’ all! Lup’ll never shape for owt o’ <i>that</i>
sort, I doubt.”</p>

<p>On the bank Lup turned sharply without lingering
or hesitation, and dropped down into the road, the
dogs springing on the instant, as if part of him. Looking
straight before him, he made off towards Ninekyrkes,
and they saw his fine, dark profile as he stooped to
hasp a gate. Then he was gone, and the waste was
empty as before. And in that moment Mrs. Dockeray
forgot her daughter and forwent her methods, pressing
her working face to the cold glass. Francey heard her
say: “Good lad, Lup! God bless you; good lad!”
and when she stood up beside her, she saw the quick
tears running down the kind cheek.</p>

<p>“He’ll come back!” she found herself saying,
vaguely wondering how the post of comforter had come
to be reversed, and the elder woman nodded, passing
her hand over her eyes, her subtle diplomacy broken
at last to plain words.</p>

<p>“Ay, he’ll come back, I reckon, but he’ll happen
come too late! Folk change—there’s no getting past
it; we’ve got to face it out! I’ve always thought a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
deal of Lup. He’s the real thing, all through. Eh!
an’ there’s poor Martha losing her lad! It doesn’t
bide thinking on. I doubt it’ll just about finish her;
there’s lile or nowt to her as it is. It’s her happiness
as’ll drive off atween the shafts o’ the cart. Ay, my
lass, and it’s your happiness as’ll take the road along
wi’ him an’ all! What’s the use o’ schoolin’ an’ such-like
if it sets you snirpin’ at the right stuff? I’ve had
a good man myself, mannerly and decent, but I’ve
had to be the gray mare, as I reckon you know, Michael’s
that soft an’ easy led. He leans on me, does Michael,
and I’d not have it different, nay, nor him neither;
but there’s something better than that for a woman,
and you’d have had it from Lup. He’d have been
master; he’s strong enough for both an’ more, and
you’d have been glad of it, every year. I’m not blaming
you. It’s me that’s to blame, being over fond an’
wanting the best for you could be got. You were such
a bonny barn an’ that smart, I’d have scraped the
roads to get you learned an’ done by like a lady!
Ay—<i>fond</i>—I was that! But what was to tell your
happiness lay just over yon fence, an’ me blinding your
eyes to it? I’ve done you a terrible big wrong. I can
see that now, right enough. You’ll sorrow for it all
your life, if you send him off. You’ve just to say the
word, and he’ll bide. Say it, my lass! You’ll be rare
an’ glad when it’s done.”</p>

<p>The door opened wider very gently, and Michael
looked in.</p>

<p>“That you, missis? You’re wanted. Francey badly,
this morning?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dockeray wiped her eyes hastily and bustled
towards him.</p>

<p>“Nay, nowt o’ t’ sort! You get along downstairs,
an’ the lass’ll follow. You might have given a body
a shout, instead of bursting in as if t’ house was afire!”</p>

<p>At the door she turned.</p>

<p>“You’ve just to say the word!” she urged.</p>

<p>But Francey did not say it.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>Denny had begged the honour of driving him to the
station, and turned up with the ramper about nine,
a small “Jack” at one lamp-bracket, and the “Stars
and Stripes” at the other. Lup stayed stolidly on the
step until he removed them. The dogs sniffed and
whined at the bags as they were lifted into the trap.
In the dull light everything took on a deadened effect,
utterly dismal and forlorn, from the melancholy house
on the edge of the dreary flat to the two worn figures
with their set faces and shut hands. At the gate the
cowman waited for a last word. Through the window
the “girl” peered at the little scene. The dogs leaped
at Lup, whimpering and beseeching, refusing to be
stilled.</p>

<p>Denny’s efforts to lighten the atmosphere did not go
far. His flags had not drawn even a smile; his new
tale about Brack died on his lips. In the silent trouble
before him even his frothing joy in life sank and
drowned.</p>

<p>Lup took a step towards the cart as though meaning
to leave without farewell, and then stopped. As if
driven by whips, he strode back to his mother and
kissed her; to his father he gave his hand. None of
the three spoke. Their eyes did not meet. The
tradition of silence, of fatalistic stoicism, gripped them
all alike in that last moment.</p>

<p>At the gate he dropped a word and a shake to the
man as he wished him luck, and out in the road turned—once—to
look behind, set against the skyline in the
high-wheeled trap. But only the “girl” at the casement
waved; the couple in the porch made no sign.
Only their weak, old eyes, strong in inward vision,
followed him tirelessly on the long miles.</p>

<p>Passing Ladyford, master, mistress and hands were
out to speed him. A horseshoe took the place of the
discarded “Jack.” Mrs. Dockeray was weeping again—into
a large muffler meant for his wearing on board.
Something of value passed in Michael’s grip, but there
was no word either of or from Francey, and this time
he did not turn on the road. He did not dare. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
might be that he would see her, after all, come too
late.</p>

<p>He slid a hand over the back of the seat, and a tongue
came up and licked it. Behind the tongue was a
brown dog-body hidden between the bags. The miles
flew by in the misty morning. The drifting hails of
friendly tongues came faintly to his dulled brain.
Even Denny seemed very far off. Only the ache in
his heart was real, and the warm tongue reaching
comfort to his hand.</p>

<p>In Sunflatts they met Lancaster, and drew up for a
last word, and long after they had disappeared the
agent stood staring up the street. The changes were
beginning. Lup was gone. What came next?</p>

<p>He was to take the express at Oxenholme, and as
they pulled into the station, Brack’s car snorted up
behind, setting the ramper on end, and scaring the
brown dog between the bags. They had already met
him, miles away, taking an opposite direction altogether,
yet here he was at their heels. He seemed uneasy, too,
fixing them when they were not looking, and walking
away when they turned. If he had been meeting
anybody, he would have said so, surely, and he took no
ticket himself, only loitered on the platform, tugging
at his moustache and staring. However, when the
train thundered in, and Denny was busy holding to
the ramper with one hand and the howling brown dog
with the other, he seemed to make up his mind.</p>

<p>“Just pulling out, I reckon?” he observed at the
carriage-door, his casual tone rather more casual than
usual. “Well, I hope you’ll find my luck meeting you
on the other side. Tell them I sent you along, with my
love, as one of the best! And—and—we’ll see to your
folk for you, those of us left behind.”</p>

<p>Lup nodded something that could scarcely, even with
the best intentions, have been termed gratitude. The
other lighted a cigarette nervously. The luggage was
in, the guard looking round for the last time. Suddenly
Brack jumped to the footboard.</p>

<p>“When do you sail?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>“Thirtieth March.”</p>

<p>“Liverpool till then?”</p>

<p>“Ay. Take time! We’re moving.”</p>

<p>“What address?”</p>

<p>“Nay, what it’s no—get out, man! We’re off!”</p>

<p>“<i>The address?</i>”</p>

<p>“Five, Derby Road.”</p>

<p>Angry hands tore Brack from the express, and more
or less hurled him off the station and into his car, but
for once he was too distracted to resent interference
with his personal dignity. He did not hear Denny’s
polite inquiry after the pigs. He even drove away
with his hat on the middle of his head, and a dead
cigarette hanging limply from his mouth.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The sale was over. The Whinnerahs had seen their
possessions catalogued and scattered, saving only a
remnant for the furnishing of the little Pride. Wolf
had gone the round of the house, handling each piece
for the last time as if it had been a pet beast, but his
wife had made no sign, refusing to quiver at the blow
of the hammer. When the end came, it was she,
lately so shrinking and afraid, who led the man out
into the waste.</p>

<p>The closing door echoed its drear Amen through the
deserted building. The empty house followed them
with its desolate, hollow eyes—the bent man clinging
to the frail woman in her old-fashioned mantle and
neat bonnet, the dispirited dogs slinking at their heels.
He would have turned again for a last wander through
the shippons had she not held him with her thin fingers.
To the left, as they walked, the heaving gray of the
sea reached out into the still gray of the sky. The
Lugg itself looked gray, and ruggedly old. Below it
the tide was running strongly, lipping far up the Let
and filling the estuaries. It seemed a forty years’
travel in the wilderness, this sad progress out of life,
but at last, a few hundred yards beyond where the road
ceased and became a track, their new home waited
their slow approach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>Mrs. Dockeray and Francey were there to welcome
them, and had brought a cheerful homeliness into the
isolated cottage, setting a kettle singing in the kitchen,
and a bowl of Ladyford snowdrops on the wooden
table. The old couple’s chairs were in their usual
places at the hearth. Wolf’s patchwork cushion was
ready to his shoulders, and the last week’s <i>Gazette</i>
put to his hand. On the wall, Mrs. Whinnerah’s proud
“Peter” hung in all his glory of burnished copper,
and a set of cherished willow-pattern stood to attention
in the little pot-rail. A thick cloth hearthrug promised
comfort to the dogs. On the miniature oak-floored
landing the Ninekyrkes “grandfather,” an ancient
Whinnerah name on his brass face, swung a deep,
almost human note down the shallow stairs.</p>

<p>The mantelpiece held a tobacco-jar and a tin or
two, and, cheek by jowl with a Sheffield candlestick,
was a photograph of Lup, looking very black and
white and square and fierce and awkward and dull.
In the waiting moments before they caught the slow
footsteps, Francey looked long at this travesty of the
original, and knew that, just as the cold negative had
ignored his living, breathing humanity, so her own
cold, critical sense had robbed him of sympathy and
glamour. They should have no eyes to see, she thought
bitterly, who have not also wide, tolerant hearts to
feel, brewing their own transmuting elixir of love.
Yet she had thought to taste it, once, had stooped her
head to it to drink, before Wolf, at that fatal supper,
had coarsened it on her lips.</p>

<p>She heard her mother in the passage, sweeping in
the outcasts on a breeze of cheer that made even the
dogs lift depressed ears, but she herself stayed rather
nervously on the hearth, stirring the brisk fire into a
mighty “low,” and filling the pot as soon as the wayfarers
were snug in their seats. Over the cups a little
consolation crept up and took hold, and now and then
there was actually weak laughter in the lonely little
house. The afternoon died, and presently, when Wolf
began to nod in his chair, when the dogs had finished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
exploring and settled on the rug with great, sleepy
sighs of satisfaction, the comforters took their leave.</p>

<p>There were other visitors, though, even then;
Michael, looking in for a short chat, and Denny, flying
over with a few pounds of apples and a present of twist;
even their late cowman, “just to see if they were
settling-like”; but when the last figure had passed the
window and melted into the dusk, the vast loneliness
came down upon the Pride, swallowing it as before.</p>

<p>The soothing sounds within—Wolf’s quiet breathing,
the soft snoring of the dogs, the crackle of the fire, the
patient speech of the clock—seemed to intensify the
mighty silence without. There was no voice from
shippon or dairy to give a sense of warm nearness and
surrounding companionship. Facing the still-glimmering
window, the wakeful woman gathered no feeling
of protection from the well-built walls; seemed, rather,
to be out unsheltered in the green emptiness, with the
chill night settling heavily down. She could still
mark the Lugg, dark against the paler sky, but the tide
beyond it had been gone more than an hour; she knew
it, though she could not see it. She folded her hands
and laid her head against the woollen antimacassar,
looking back over the years. The time for looking
forward was past. Gradually, the pain of exile drew
away. Here, in the very shadow of her great dread,
it ceased to hold her, leaving her lapped in peace.
There came to her, too, the consciousness of power, of
victory almost, in the mere fact of having lived, which
gives to old age, however humble, its own peculiar
dignity. “<i>My</i> life!”—says every soul—“that sum
of happenings which is mine and mine alone, that
wonderful and dreadful pilgrimage that I have made
with Time. Whatever the record, I have lived, finished
the course, bound myself to Eternity by the tendrils
of experience and growth.”</p>

<p>Her eyes closed slowly as the Lugg faded from view.
The fire sank a little; the dogs turned and sighed; the
shadows crept in. On the flickering hearth the old
man and the old woman slept, dreamless.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>SPURS TO GLORY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Slowly</span>, very slowly, the faintly-shifting kaleidoscope
of the months adjusted Dandy to her new
conditions. The first sense of stagnation, following on
the hurry of Halsted, was replaced gradually by a
feeling of steady movement and expansion. The days
were alive but never feverish. She came to see that
rampant activity does not always mean progression,
that the stimulant of rush may finally produce stupefaction,
and flying feet carry one over all the great truths
of life. The country’s gift was hers—time to grow.</p>

<p>But the gift came gauntleted, she found. It had its
Judgment Book, its Black List, its Penal Code. There
were long evenings with nobody at hand to deliver
her from herself, long, hopeless days with a heart like
a spurless steed, and long, terrible nights when the
ghosts of the place woke her to clamour in cold hate
at her presence. For Watters would not always own
her. It had its brutal hours, when the very garden
was sinister and the eyes of the house had no soul, and
terror waited at every turn of the stair. She came to
know, too, the penalty of identifying her mood with
that of the weather—the cruel relentlessness of storm,
the utter soullessness of glaring heat, the cynicism of an
edged wind, the inquisition-beat of hail.</p>

<p>Yet for these what exquisite consolation! Exhilaration
of frost, peace of still days swung on a soft, low
wind, inspiration of light and shade and mist and
evening sun. She learned, too, to look on the rain as a
dominant personality ruling great issues. At Halsted,
after scorching days of tennis, a healing drizzle soft
as down, blotting out the day and whispering through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
the night, brought no comment except—“Filthy
weather! Shut it out!”—but here they said of it:
“It’s doing rarely—coming down nicely—doing
grand!” thinking in the dark of tarns filling in the
lonely hills, and listening to the drinking earth with
a sense of personal benefit, and almost of personal
achievement. And when the big winds came, so that
the lights quivered and the beds shook and the carpets
flapped like bunting, you did not say, as at Halsted:
“Just the night for ‘Everybody’s Doing It’—what?
Somebody order the closed car!” but you wondered
under which hedge the sheep had gathered, and whether
the tide was over the road at Sandfoot, and if, by some
miracle of endurance, the frail old ash would live till
morning.</p>

<p>Moreover, the country sense of clannish commonness
in so much took her by degrees, giving her whole new
world into her hand.</p>

<p>“I believe I’m beginning to understand,” she said
to Hamer, one day when the mood of analysis was upon
her. “I know now why old James was so angry when
we cut down that sycamore, just after we came. Why,
I could hate the whole District Council for pulling down
the ferny old wall at Abbey Corner, just because you
and I ran round it into the Chairman! Everything
seems to get up close to you in the country and make
a personal matter of itself without being asked.
Haven’t you noticed how people say, ‘Oh, the harvest
is all in, with <i>us</i>!’ or, ‘<i>We</i> did splendidly in roots!’
even if they own nothing but an ivy-strangled cottage
with a lean-to henpen and a border of nasturtiums?
It grows on you, somehow. Everybody does it. Why,
only last week, when those horrid cousins of mother’s
motored through, and did nothing but grumble about
the Westmorland butter, I found myself saying: ‘It
can’t have been local. <i>Ours</i> has been winning all
over the place!’ just as if I’d been raising prize
pats on my own account, instead of Harriet and Mrs.
Wilson!”</p>

<p>“It’s great!” Hamer answered, irrelevantly but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
comprehensively, as he had answered, months before.
He had a fat book or two in his arm.</p>

<p>“Doing anything this evening, Dandy Anne? I’m
going over to Wild Duck with these, and I thought of
bringing Knewstubb back with me.”</p>

<p>“<i>Need</i> we have him to dinner again to-night?”
Dandy sighed. “(No. The V.A.D. was yesterday,
and the S.P. something-or-other’s to-morrow.) I’m
sure I know every hair on that wretched Lapwing, by
now! And two of the maids have threatened to give
notice if he goes on calling them ‘Skirts.’ Harriet
says it’s his generic term for all women-servants, just
as he calls all the men ‘Whiskers,’ but it isn’t very
polite. I wish you’d give him a hint, Daddy dear.”</p>

<p>Hamer looked troubled.</p>

<p>“Of course I don’t want to pester you with him,
little girl, but I can’t help worrying and wanting to
lever him out of his rut. A man with my luck ought
to be handing it round if he can. Knewstubb isn’t bad
all through. He’s only—careless. He’s begun to
take an interest in one or two things going, lately.
And, anyway, my whisky’s better than the ‘White
Lion’s.’”</p>

<p>“How you are scooping in the shekels up aloft,
Daddy dear! If you’re not careful, you’ll break the
bank. Why, yes, Stubbs is quite a different creature
already, and you’ve started others stretching a hand
to him, too. They made him a platform ornament at
the last Conservative meeting, and several good souls
are trying to push him into positions of trust. It
won’t be your fault if you don’t waft him into Heaven
among you!”</p>

<p>Hamer looked more troubled than ever.</p>

<p>“You’re not sneering at me, are you, Dandy Anne?”</p>

<p>“Oh, <span class="allsmcap">DARLING</span>!” Dandy took the fat books from
him, and put herself in their place. “Now may the
Bald-Head Bears come out of Crag Yeat Wood and
gobble me up! As if I didn’t just worship you and
your trams, and mean to ride into glory at the tail of
one of them! Ask the Stubbs, by all means, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
will get him to teach me the Farmers’ Shuffle for the
fifteenth time, while you have your after-dinner nap.
And you might ask the Forgotten Parson and the Lonely
Lady with the Policeman’s Rattle. Let’s have a real
Tram-Party while we’re about it. There’s the Grammar-School-Master,
too, who blew himself up, last
week. I met him this morning, wandering about in
bandages and a splint. He hasn’t a spare hand, so
you’ll have to feed him. Shall I tell mother dinner
for seven? And then let me walk over to Wild Duck
with you, and help to carry the books. I want to
see Harriet about ‘Elijah.’”</p>

<p>They found the lady-farmer round by the shippons,
on the point of climbing into the float between the
shining milkcans. It was growing dusk as they went
up the gravelled path, and already a light showed in
the pretty farm-house. Snowdrops were thick in the
garden, and a band of yellow crocus edged the foot of
the whitewashed porch. Over the dividing wall they
could hear Harriet directing the lighting of the sparkling
lamps.</p>

<p>“Just taking the milk to the Workhouse,” she informed
them, as they appeared through the little gate.
“Martindale is laid up with rheumatics, and there’s
some complaint I want to settle in person. Stubbs is
indoors, if you’ve brought that dull-looking inkhorn-stuff
for him. You might keep him stodging at it till
I get back. I shan’t be long, so don’t clear out before
I’ve had a chin with you. Right, horse—get along
off!”</p>

<p>She spun out of the yard with the flashing cans,
flourishing her whip as she rounded the turn, and
swaying easily to the swing of the trap. Hamer
looked after her admiringly.</p>

<p>“I like a woman with a straight back!” he observed.
“It means a lot more than you’d think.
It’s a pleasure to watch that girl move. She’s real
grit bent on getting there all the time!”</p>

<p>“Ay, she’s a devil to meet, but an angel to follow!”
Stubbs commented at his elbow. “She’s got my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
figure”—the check swelled proudly—“but I’m hanged
if she’s got my face! Deuced plain, <i>I</i> call her. Don’t
know where she picked it up. And the very dickens
for language, though I’m d——d if I know where she
gets <i>that</i>, either! Come along in, won’t you, and have
a glass of—snow about somewhere, I’ll swear!”</p>

<p>Through the deep-seated porch into the narrow
passage, where a staring stag’s head threatened their
own from the pink-washed wall, they came into the
snug parlour, and soon Hamer and Stubbs were happy
with a fat book between them under the lamp on the
round table. The fire chuckled merrily, and the lustre
ornaments on the mantelpiece caught the dancing light
and flashed it on to the brass candlesticks and a gilt
beer-barrel of a clock. Above the clock was a black
paper silhouette of Harriet’s grandfather, <i>the</i> John
Knewstubb, Prop of the County. It was a man’s
room, from the business-like bureau to the prints and
the books—county, agricultural, sporting and veterinary—the
leather leggings flung at the side of the hearth,
and the silver-bound carriage-whip in the corner.
Yet it was here that Harriet spent most of her scanty
indoor hours, and the room was as much hers as her
father’s. There was no sign of feminine occupation,
nor a single softening touch, but for all that it was cosy
and cheerful with the homeliness that clings imperishably
to the farm-house, the fundamental, abiding home
of all. It had the real farm-house smell, too—Dandy
was beginning to recognise it, and was proud of the
fact—the smell that registered it as the Holy of Holies
of many a past generation.</p>

<p>A kitten was flung, white-pawed and drowsy, on the
red window-seat, and, drawing it to her knee, she
looked through the narrow panes into the gathering
shadows. Hamer glanced up once from the printed
page and across to her dreaming face, and a look of
whimsical distress came into his own. He had lost
his girl, he knew that; had known it ever since the
night she had danced with the fairies through a Gate
of Vision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span></p>

<p>The minutes slid by, bringing no roll of returning
wheels, but presently, across the men’s talk and the
song of the furry sleepiness in her lap, Dandy caught the
sound of voices on the path—Helwise’s first, penetrating
as escaping steam, and then Lancaster’s, deep and
abrupt, followed by the framing of their figures in the
arc flung on the night. Helwise plunged in at the
porch, still babbling, but Lanty stayed a moment,
arrested, and through the little, old casement he and
Hamer’s daughter sent glance to meet glance. So had
he seen her in the car, he remembered, her charming,
wistful head aureoled in light. That picture had
remained; this, too, held him. There was to be a
third also, kept for an hour as yet mercifully hid from
both.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Helwise had streamed into the passage
and through the parlour door, and had addressed at
least half a paragraph to Harriet before she discovered
that she wasn’t in the room. Stubbs said “H——ll
of a bore!” under his breath, and “Milk. Back in
a jiff!” above it, and retired into the fat book without
more ado. He couldn’t stand Helwise at any price.
It was Hamer who got up, put her into the rocker and
lifted her feet to the fender, loosened her furs and
plunged a poker into the red coals. The big man loved
waiting on the piece of deceptively-appealing inconsequence,
and of course Helwise loved it, too, so
they were both happy. Dandy moved her eyes from
the window with a start, and stood up politely to offer
her a cushion.</p>

<p>Stubbs looked relieved when he saw Lancaster, and
drew him down to the table, pointedly turning his
back upon his female relative, but she soon wore him
into silence. She was upset, it appeared, about the
forthcoming oratorio in Bluecaster. The church was
small, and it seemed that there would be a squash for
the Choral Society. Forms would have to be added to
the choir-stalls. The Vicar had written Miss Lancaster,
as Secretary of the Society, to know whether Elijah and
Co. might be accommodated on chairs on the chancel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
steps, and, if so, whether the chairs should be plain
or upholstered. Miss Lancaster was of opinion that
the chairs in question ought to be the Vicar’s best
saddle-bags, and had answered to that effect—a suggestion
indignantly vetoed by the Vicar’s wife. The
Vicar had replied that, according to <i>his</i> humble judgment,
large and bulgy saddle-bags were in keeping
neither with the appointments of a church nor with the
original entourage of Elijah and his troupe. Helwise
had responded with quotations: “The Lord loveth a
cheerful giver,” and “Whatever, Lord, we lend to
Thee, repaid a thousandfold will be,” envisaging the
terrible prospect of countless saddle-bags prancing
cumbrously up the Vicarage drive. This Biblical
trespassing had been taken in bad part by the other
side, and Elijah bade fair to fall between two stools.
Lanty having refused to show any interest whatever
in the matter, Helwise had flown to Harriet, who, it
seemed, was at the Workhouse. Stubbs audibly
wished them both at Hong-Kong, and Elijah along
with them.</p>

<p>Hamer came soothingly to the rescue. He happened
to have some old chairs that were exactly the thing.
In fact, he rather believed that they had been church-wood,
to begin with. He would be delighted to lend
them, and also to send them, if they would be of service.
He even borrowed notepaper from the disgusted
Stubbs, and sat down to write to the Vicar at Helwise’s
dictation. Lanty, in the window, stroking
White-Paws on Dandy’s lap, growled a remonstrance,
which she checked. “Oh, please let him!” she begged
under her breath; and, remembering that Wiggie
would occupy one of the chairs, he said no more.
Stubbs rattled off a string of all the most swear-sounding
rotifera he could think of.</p>

<p>To the tune of a spanking trot Harriet dashed into
the yard, and strode in, a fine colour in her sallow
cheeks, and every fighting bristle raised for war.
Hospitality dragged from her a brief recognition of the
later arrivals as they rose to greet her, but she paid it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
no further dues. Stubbs brightened. Evidently there
had been a row.</p>

<p>“Worm!” said Harriet, slapping down her hard
gauntlets under Helwise’s nose. “Caterpillar! Bloodless,
backboneless caterpillar! To dare to talk to <i>me</i>
about milk—<span class="allsmcap">ME!</span> Knewstubb of Wild Duck! Centipede—white-livered,
backstair crawler—Earwig!
<span class="allsmcap">CROCODILE!</span>”</p>

<p>The Shaws paled—this was a new and dreadful
Harriet—but Stubbs merely hallooed: “Sick ’em,
lass! Good dog—hie on to him!” snapping his
fingers with keen enjoyment, and even Helwise seemed
unconcerned. As for Lanty, he laughed with evident
understanding.</p>

<p>“Thorne, I suppose, is it? I’ve seen him slinking
into the Workhouse once or twice lately as I passed.
Afraid he thinks no great shakes of me as his fellow-Guardian.
It isn’t often I get time to look in. I fancy
he gives them a pretty thin time there, poking about
and finding fault.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Ollivant Thorne. ‘Creeping Jesus’ they
call him in the village, with his slimy voice and his
shifty eyes! What are you all on your hind legs for,
by the way? I’ve a lot to say, so you may as well
ease up to it. That’s better! It was like this:
Lambert sent me a private note to say that Thorne
didn’t think the milk up to standard, so I went round
myself to see about it, and there if you please was the
Creeping Jesus, waiting ready to sniff at the milkcan
as soon as it stopped at the door. Of course I asked
him where the devil he had learned anything about
milk with his death’s head always stuck in a ledger,
and he said he was there to see that the poor were not
being fleeced by a flummoxing farmer. I replied that
the milk was the best in the county, as anybody but a
long-eared sarsaparilla raised on barley-water and
lemon wouldn’t need telling, and he said that language
wasn’t allowed in the Sacred Precincts of the Pure
Pauper, and that he should parley with the Board,
and have the contract taken from me. I told him he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
could sue me for jumping it on the spot, and tried to
come away and the milk with me, but Lambert nearly
wept, so of course I turned soft and let him have it.
He said awful things about Thorne when the Creeping
Jesus had bunked, but of course that’s unofficial,
so you must keep it dark. The creature’s had his
knife into me ever since I chucked him out for trying
some stuff on Stubbs that he called a perfect substitute
for whisky. Stubbs was ill for days afterwards—weren’t
you, Stubbs?—and I had to stick upstairs
nursing him and let the farm slide.”</p>

<p>“Thorne?” Hamer pondered. “I know the man.
Excise—insurance—law—what is he? Something
parchmenty, anyhow. Had two hours of him one
day, and never guessed what he was after until the
last five minutes, when he tried to get some work out
of me. Wouldn’t trust him as far as I could throw
him. County odd-jobber, isn’t he, as well?”</p>

<p>Lanty nodded.</p>

<p>“Rural District Council. Attends like his prayers.
I share the honour with him. We’ve been returned
unopposed at least twice, and there’s nobody coming
up against us this time either that I know of. Election
in March. Afraid I don’t lay myself out much to
oblige. The estate carries me, and Thorne has a select
band of slummites that he beats up for the occasion.”</p>

<p>“Estate be hanged!” Harriet jeered. “Lanty’s
shoving his head in the sand, Mr. Shaw. He doesn’t
need to canvass, because the district, in its rational
moments, happens to know a useful man when it sees
one. Thorne always works like a black if he thinks
there’s a chance of a fight. You’ll find him slumming
for months beforehand—the carping old milk-sniffer!
I’ve half a mind to stand against him myself.”</p>

<p>The words meant nothing, spoken in a last leaping
spasm of annoyance, but after a pause Hamer said
“Why not?” very quietly; and after a second pause—of
astonishment, this time—Stubbs suddenly said
“Why not?” too. Indeed, he got solemnly to his
feet and repeated it, extending a check arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span></p>

<p>“Why not? In the family. Always in the family!
Rur’l D’trict C’cillor myself, once upon a time”—so
he had been, in forgotten ages—“father Rur’l
D’trict C’cillor, too. Chairman, in fact. Chairman
myself but for accident. Other important business—you
all know! Father great man, very highly respected.
Chairman. In the family. Always in the
family!”</p>

<p>Harriet said—“Oh, cheese it, Stubbs!” looking
embarrassed, but the colour had risen again in her
cheeks, and she pulled the gauntlets back and fidgeted
with them.</p>

<p>“We all remember John Knewstubb,” Lancaster
paid tribute. “His work for the county will stand for
many a long year.” He looked laughingly at Harriet.
“Come on! I’m sure his granddaughter will find
plenty of backers.”</p>

<p>“Bunkum!” Harriet frowned uncomfortably. He
was not serious, she knew, but her colour mounted
higher. “You’re talking through your hats. Of
course I can’t do it!”—and again came the query,
placidly from Hamer, importantly from Stubbs.</p>

<p>“But isn’t she too—young?” Dandy put in, gazing
with awe at the proposed candidate. “Of course,
I know they do have ladies sometimes, but not—not
like Harriet.” Excitement conquered doubt. “Oh,
Harriet, <i>do</i>, and we’ll all help! Dad and I will canvass
for you, and Miss Lancaster and Wiggie—Wiggie will
love it, and nobody ever refuses him anything”—she
pulled up suddenly, biting her lip. “We shall all
be so proud of you, if you get in!”</p>

<p>“Lancelot won’t let me canvass,” Helwise lamented.
“Such a good opportunity for collecting subscriptions,
too! He says they’re side-issues, whatever that may
mean. But I’m sure they’d put you in, Harriet, even
without me. You know you always get the egg-accounts
within a shilling or two.”</p>

<p>And Stubbs said: “In the family. Always in the
family. Rur’l D’trict C’cillor!” with a final wave
that abolished one of the lustres, and the diversion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
gave the visitors their chance to move. Harriet
refused the Shaws’ invitation both for herself and her
father.</p>

<p>“I’m going to write to the Creeping Jesus, and it’ll
take me all evening. I’ve remembered lots of things
I could have said and didn’t, and I’ll want Stubbs by
me to put in the adjectives. He’ll be as happy as a
king with that and the microbes. We’ll come some
other night, if you’ll have us. You’d better take a
light, hadn’t you? It’ll be as black as a hearse in the
lane.”</p>

<p>She lighted a lantern, and walked with them to the
gate. Behind her straight, boyish figure the well-kept
house spoke of comfort, honesty and respect.
She snapped the latch after them with a firm hand.</p>

<p>“Good-night. And good luck!” Lanty called
laughingly. “I shan’t mind standing down to John
Knewstubb’s successor!”</p>

<p>Harriet grunted with annoyance.</p>

<p>“Stow all that piffle! You’re as safe as houses, and
you know it. It’s Thorne I’d be out to rattle; I’d
make no difference to <i>you</i>. And in any case I’m not
doing it. You’ll only set Stubbs agitating. I wish
you’d chuck it!”</p>

<p>But as she went slowly back up the path, the stray-flung
idea settled and took root. It was absurd, of
course, and she was much too young, too insignificant,
and—only a woman; but after all she was doing a
man’s job in a man’s place, and doing it well. She
had earned respect in her own line—there was no
doubt about that—and she’d as good a head-piece as
most of the old buffers on the Board, thank the powers!
It would be a fine old crow over the Creeping Jesus if
she bagged his post. Might be a help in business as
well, now she came to think of it. She was bred to it,
too, as Stubbs had said. A certain knowledge of Poor
Law and County management comes the way of most
country people, but Harriet, brought up by her grandfather,
had breathed it in with her native air. She
could still cite many a point of importance which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
had made familiar, repeat stories of difficulties triumphantly
solved. She loved it, too; all the machinery and
the ceremony and the cracking of nuts with Nasmyth
hammers. Association and instinct alike made the
dull things dear and vivid. There are few stronger
claims in certain families than this obligation of
service, passing from one generation to another. On
the backs of its often inadequate but willing gentry
the agricultural county moves forward, exorbitant
with them because it has bred them, exacting more
of them with each succeeding year, and only they know
what it gives them in return. Titles—silver—illuminated
addresses—a squad of police to walk before their
coffin—a portrait to hang behind their empty chair—these
make their testimony; but the real guerdon is
surely immeasurably different and beyond.</p>

<p>Later, in her own room, the deeper reason—the
woman’s reason—spoke for itself. Dandy had said:
“We shall all be proud of you.” “All?” Would <i>he</i>
care if she went in to fight and came out victorious,
honour her because honour had come her way? The
suggestion had amused him; he had not taken it
seriously, but it had roused him to new interest in
her, nevertheless. She had thrilled at his homage to
her grandfather; <i>that</i> had been serious and genuine,
without question, and the reflection, if pale, had yet
been hers. The possible venture would surely bring
her a little nearer! She would share some measure
of his work, lay her hand to it beside his, join in the
common endeavour. Thorne and the milk-insult were
forgotten. The woman’s reason, the woman’s hope,
urged her forward. Lighting a candle, she slipped
silently down to the sitting-room, and drew out one
of her grandfather’s books.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>THE GREEN GATES OF VISION:—IV. DARK—THE
LONELY PLOUGH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the road, Dandy came to halt, dismayed.</p>

<p>“It’s too late, now, for the rest of the Tram-Party,
and there’s all that food hurrying to meet them!
Miss Lancaster, please come and help to eat it.”</p>

<p>“The boy, too,” Hamer added. He often called
Lancaster “the boy,” with a quaint, protective accent.
“We’ll catch it from Mother if you don’t lend a hand,
giving her all that trouble for nothing. Don’t you
hark to Dandy Anne—the Tram-Party’s only her
nonsense. She wanted to give one or two down-in-the-mouth
folk a bit of a feed, but they’ll have to have
their particular wire-in another night. You’ll come,
won’t you now? We’ll send you back in the car.”</p>

<p>Lancaster hesitated, his business-conscience pricking,
but his aunt’s declaration that she could not remember
whether she had ordered tinned sardines, or tongue,
or both, or neither, for their evening meal, did not
tend to waken his homing instinct, and he found himself
following up the Lane, swinging the lantern over
Dandy’s path. It was black, as Harriet had prophesied.
In the shifting light the hedges looked huge and dense,
climbing to where their sombre tops scarred the fainter
dark of the starless heaven, and every curve and turn
loomed a barrier impenetrable as the Sleeping Beauty’s
Forest. The dream-traps yawned emptily, with witless
mouths and vacant eyes.</p>

<p>“Will Harriet really stand, do you think?” Dandy
asked, keeping with difficulty in the middle of the narrow
road, so subtly were track and hedge blended by the
Northern night. “It was only a joke, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>“Well, it started as a joke, of course, but I shouldn’t
wonder if it didn’t end there. It would be an innovation,
just here, but there must always be pioneers,
and the lot may have fallen to Harriet. She’s young,
but she’s a better man than Thorne, not only in position,
but in business and brain. I shouldn’t be surprised
if she does have a shot at it. You see, her grandfather’s
name still carries weight, and in this county
half of us run our reputations on those of our forbears.”</p>

<p>“That’s true enough!” Dandy laughed. “Why,
only the other day, when we were going over Bluecaster,
I heard you say to the housekeeper: ‘Tell
me who her mother was, and I’ll know what she is!’
It all comes back to the same thing.”</p>

<p>“There’s a lot of reason in it, though, don’t you
think? You’ll hear the very man who breeds prize-dogs
and specialises in orchids insist that all human beings
are equal. He’ll sniff at a cross-bred mongrel and sneer
at a dandelion, but he’ll tell you straight that he himself
is as good as the bluest blood and the finest stock,
though he may be sprung from a collier’s cot or twenty
nameless mixed strains. ’Tisn’t common sense, to
my thinking! There is no good or evil done, (fine
thoughts put into shape or base ones grown secretly,)
but blossoms again somehow in later lives. We’ve
got to fight our own way, but there’s both help and
binding from those gone before.”</p>

<p>“But you—surely you stand alone?”</p>

<p>They were well on towards Watters by now, and the
rhythmic dance of the light had broken over one of the
gaps, catching a sudden reflection from clean steel.
They stopped to look.</p>

<p>It was only a plough, flung on its side in the hedge,
waiting the morrow and renewal of toil. The bright
share told that it had been in use that day, and Lanty
knew that, near it in the dark, the long, clean furrows
curved up over the hill. It seemed a small, inadequate
tool for its great work; simple, too, as are all enduring
things; yet it had the whole of history behind it.</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose I do,” he said at last. “We all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
stand alone, if it comes to that. We drive our furrow
single-handed, out of the dark into the dark, though
we’ve got to reckon with the soil that others have
left, just as others must reckon with our leavings after
us. But it’s our job while we’re on to it, all the same.
It’s our job while the light lasts, to make the best of
it we can. It’s always one man’s hand on the lonely
plough.”</p>

<p>For a long moment they stood silent, ringed round
by the night, in closer communion than they had ever
found themselves. Strange talk still and new was
this, but she did not shrink from it, now; and he,
opening his heart, did not find it shuttered by an alien
hand. Together they looked through the dim Gate,
so near that, when he stooped his head to the lantern,
he felt her hair against his face.</p>

<p>Calls for help came out of the vast beyond, and they
took guiltily to pursuit, to find Helwise and Hamer
marooned up a blind alley in the swamping sea of the
dark, and, as they set them right again, a new elf-candle
appeared from the opposite direction, having
Wiggie somewhere in its vicinity. He was just back
from an engagement in town, and in the glowing hall
at Watters looked shockingly thin and ill, though
excellently clothed and brushed, making Lancaster
conscious of muddy boots and the general wear of a
busy day. He began to have his favourite complaint
of feeling old, and when Dandy, after a miracle-change
into something softly pink, danced in to dinner on the
singer’s arm, the lightly-welded link of the Lane snapped
as lightly, leaving her farther than before.</p>

<p>Wiggie had brought her from town an infinite
variety of excitements, new books, new music, even
new fashions, described after his own manner. There
was also an umbrella-thing meant especially for
country use—so they had told him in London; indeed,
they had been quite feverish about it. You could sit on
it when you went shooting or fishing or mushrooming
or marketing on Saturday, and it had buttoned
pockets for carrying anything from grouse to reels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
of cotton, and collapsible spokes that could be adjusted
to cover any part of a hat, and a purse and a pocket-handkerchief
and a plate with the owner’s name.
He had practised with it in the train, but he had been
dreadfully stupid and allowed it to take steck in the
door, so that, when the train stopped, none of the
ordinary umbrella-people inside could get out, and a
very cross inspector on the platform couldn’t get in.
However, the collapsible spokes had collapsed before
they were carried on to Carlisle, and he was quite sure
that Dandy would manage them in a few lessons.
Dandy was quite certain of it, and could scarcely
live through the enormous Tram-Dinner in her anxiety
to try. It was a first-class Highways-and-Hedges
Dinner; and now that Wiggie had turned up, they
were only one or two short, after all.</p>

<p>He was immensely thrilled about Harriet, and full
of hope that the “joke” would prove serious. He
hadn’t another engagement for—oh, next door to
never!—except, of course, “Elijah” in Bluecaster—and
would love to run round and help if they would let him
stay so long. His joyousness set Dandy shining like
a clear light on gems, bringing home to Lancaster how
different she was with himself. Probably he seemed
old and staid to her, certainly dull and one-sided.
Wigmore’s was her natural atmosphere. Wiggie could
ring every pretty change on her as easily as he rippled
the vocal octave, but the elder man had no key to her
moods. The sympathy in the Lane had been shallow
and fleeting. Not here—not <i>here</i> was the making
of his “silly home”!</p>

<p>He said little during the evening, and, in the car,
showed scant enthusiasm for his aunt’s surprise-packet
from town—a large pot pug, with a chocolate-box
interior and an almanac on his chest. Wiggie loved
people’s little weaknesses, and saw no reason for refusing
to pander to them. He did it charmingly enough, too,
but, after all, it wasn’t Wiggie who had to live with the
pot dogs.</p>

<p>Helwise was in ecstasies over the luxurious car,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
and more than once nearly wrecked them all by switching
on the electric light just as the unhappy chauffeur
rounded a bend. She thought Lancelot might see
his way to giving up his horse and buying a motor.
Bluecaster would help. Look what he had done about
the bath!</p>

<p>Lanty answered unkindly that if ever he did own
a car, it would certainly not be at Bluecaster’s expense,
and that he preferred the old gee to all the petrol-puffers
in creation; and then felt ashamed when she
sighed and was hurt. No doubt he did sound cross
and discourteous after Wiggie’s chocolate-box consideration,
just as in all probability he had seemed countrified
and slow beside the singer’s wit and finish. That was
the worst of these pandering sympathisers! They
showed you up as a very bad second, though you might
really be carrying a big load quite respectably. Still,
he need not have snubbed Helwise so brutally. It was
partly Bluecaster’s own fault that she looked upon
him less as an employer than as a free emporium and
family asset. He could see him buying her the car
without a murmur. He had to admit, too, that the
padded elegance of the limousine fitted her to a nicety,
just as the luxury of Watters seemed her natural
setting. There was no doubt you couldn’t expect
the best of people out of their special environment—certainly
not weak creatures like Helwise, formed for
others to pity and sustain.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, his philosophy did little to soothe him
on arrival at their own cheerless dwelling. The fires
were all out, of course, and they were met by a wandering
odour of kippered herring not to be located anywhere,
certainly not in the burnt slices of chilly ham
congealed on the dining-room table. He found a
telephone-message from the House ingeniously concealed
in the barometer, and could have sworn that
there was a fresh scratch on the maltreated wall.
He waited while Helwise introduced the new pug to
the old collection, and then requested a candle for his
empty stick. His nightly tour discovered bolts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
unshot, gases burning and taps half-turned, not to
speak of a general back-premises condition sufficient
to set a fastidious taste hunger-striking for weeks.
And so upstairs with the rocking candle to his cold
bedroom, and had barely shut his door before Helwise
called him to unhook her gown. There was only
carbolic soap to wash with, and the kitchen fire had
long ago left the cylinder in the lurch. Probably the
flue wanted cleaning, anyhow. He thought of the
bathroom at Watters, with its hot rails and shining
taps, and hated himself for even remembering them.
They reminded him, however, that there offered to be
a sharp frost in the early hours, and he betook himself
to an icy attic to see that a certain pipe was properly
wrapped. Finally, to a lumpy bed with wandering
sheets. Sleep brought oblivion, but no magic. He did
not dream, as Dandy, of swung lanterns in a lover’s lane.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>But before that dream-flower blossomed, she asked
Hamer whether he really meant to back Harriet’s
Attempt. She was curled on the hearth at his knee,
with her mother nodding asleep at one side, and Wiggie’s
overbright eyes on the other. Hamer took his cigar
from his mouth, and pressed her head against him
before replying.</p>

<p>“I’ll let it lie till morning,” he said thoughtfully,
“and then, if it doesn’t seem too much of a forlorn
hope, I’ll run over and set her going. She won’t
need overmuch persuasion! I’m new, of course,
but I can do a bit of talking and getting folks interested.
<i>She’s</i> well enough known, and there’s a good many
that think a lot of her judgment. They’ll laugh,
at first, but I shouldn’t wonder if she went through,
and I don’t mind laying that they’ll find her pretty
useful. She’s not the ordinary woman. She looks
at things like a man, and she’s get-up-and-git enough
to run a train. She wants more outlet, too, and Fate
owes her more than a bit for that halma-board of a
father, especially as all the elections in the kingdom
will never get her the one big thing——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>He stopped abruptly. Wiggie was looking at him.</p>

<p>“Tramming again, old dear?” Dandy put up her
hand to meet his. “It’s rather a dangerous experiment,
playing Providence in your wholesale fashion.
And what do <i>you</i> know about Harriet’s ‘one big
thing’?”</p>

<p>“I was only talking. Probably I’m right out of it,
but one just wonders. Hadn’t you and Mother better
be getting off to bed?”</p>

<p>But when they had taken his advice, and Wigmore
had closed the door behind them, Hamer got up slowly
and knocked his ash into the fire, a sorrowful expression
on his handsome face.</p>

<p>“Some have Paradise and some Elections,” he said,
not looking at Wiggie, collapsed now like a tired child
in his chair. “And the others—what have the others
got, Cyril, my boy?”</p>

<p>“Dead candles and a tune in the throat!” Wiggie
answered, with closed eyes, and began to croon—</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>HAMER’S SECOND TRAM</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> it happened, Harriet’s Attempt seized the Skirts
of Happy Chance exactly at the right moment. Election
fever had been rampant during the last six weeks,
setting everybody canvassing his neighbour with
delirious zeal. First, a county by-election had been
rushed through in a glorious fourteen days of crowded
life, taking the eye of the whole country by the fact
that it was fought upon a pioneer question of national
importance. Then the County Council reorganisation
came on, loosing all the grinders at each other’s throats;
and when that had passed, leaving the different
divisions to settle down for the next three years, the
District and Parish Councils followed. All sorts of
unaccountable hatreds and differences were abroad,
as well as still stranger enthusiasms for individuals
who had not counted a snap of the fingers before.
It was amazing how blood bubbled and boiled for or
against some harmless person whose existence had
hitherto mattered about once in a blue moon. Both
men and women made each election a question of
personal insult or exaltation, and said so as often and
as loudly as possible; while the grinders ran from pillar
to post, setting everybody by the ears, and talking
loudest of all.</p>

<p>Into this whirlpool was flung the announcement
of Harriet’s candidature as Rural District Councillor
for Bluecaster. The district was still seething, but the
strain was beginning to tell, and its enthusiasm showed
signs of needing a fillip. Harriet gave it this fillip.
The older generation was scandalised, the younger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
amused or contemptuous; while the earnest ladies
who sit on Boarding-out and School Committees pronounced
it publicly to be horrid presumption, and privately
wished that they had thought of doing it themselves.
In her own neighbourhood, however, when
the first shock was over, she soon began to find supporters.
Thorne was disliked by most outside his
own peculiar, gullible clan. The story of the milk-fracas
soon got round, bringing the farmers solidly
to Harriet’s defence. Wild Duck milk needed no
bush, and though Thorne’s slummites had a pleasant
habit of shrieking “Milk O!” after his opponent,
they did not succeed in bringing the blush of shame
to the Knewstubb cheek of innocence. Ratepayers
of standing signed her nomination, and all went merry
as a marriage-bell. And in his thin, deceitful-looking,
wedge-shaped boots, Ollivant Thorne shook.</p>

<p>Harriet did not do very much canvassing on her own
account. She hadn’t the right grinding touch, which
is either very bluff and “Come-along-be-a-good-dog!”-ish,
or silkily insidious and appealing. Her request
for a vote was apt to sound more like a County Court
judgment, so she prudently left the work to her backers.
Wiggie said little, but then Wiggie’s very presence
smoothed the wrinkles out of the atmosphere and
demoralised resistance; and Dandy sat behind, ready
to hand out fresh suggestions when Hamer came to a
halt. As for Stubbs, he had but one argument, the
inevitable “In the family. Always in the family!”
but it carried weight; and it seemed as if, in reminding
others of the family honour, he was reminded of his own,
for he certainly pulled himself together during this
fateful time. But still it was Hamer who was the real
canvassing success. These local elections are carried
largely on the women, and Hamer went down with the
women all the way. He turned up each evening at
Wild Duck with his reports, triumphant over the certainties,
miserable about the failures, and worried to
death over the doubtfuls.</p>

<p>Wiggie often came with him, and on the first occasion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
was so delighted with Harriet’s dwelling that he
couldn’t be made to attend to business. Wild Duck
captured him from the start. While Hamer waved a
pencil over the lists, he wandered round the room,
worshipping the silhouette and the carriage-whip
and the beer-barrel, and was positively childish about
the clover-leaf into which Grandfather Knewstubb
had squeezed the Lord’s Prayer. He sank happily
into the comfortable rocker pulled close to the glowing
bars, cuddling the kitten in his arm, and watched the
colours floating in the lustres until Harriet’s voice in
the background—“Oh, <i>he’s</i> no good! Let him slack”—brought
him to his feet as if a live coal had sprung
at him. She looked a trifle ashamed at his earnest
apology, and, after a minute or two, muttered a word
of excuse and went to fetch him a glass of new milk
from the dairy; and when, on the following day, she
found him at the gate with a message, she actually
condescended to show him round the buildings. He
looked regretfully behind him as he turned back into
the road.</p>

<p>“I’ve always known there was a place like this
somewhere,” he said, “ever since I was top angel
in St. Somebody-Something’s choir, but I hardly
believed I should ever really find it. It’s so beautifully
restful, it almost makes me glad to be tired. I love
Watters, and it’s very patient with me, but after all
it only kind of shakes hands, whereas Wild Duck opens
its arms and takes you on its knee. You won’t sell
it, I suppose? You should have what you wanted
for it. You’re a very honest person, I know. I
wouldn’t haggle a farthing.”</p>

<p>“It’s Bluecaster property,” Harriet explained,
“though I mean to buy it in the long run, if I can get
his lordship to let me have it, and if Lanty doesn’t
want too thieving a price. When my grandfather
died, we had to turn out of the old place, and I took
Wild Duck on the money he left me, though everybody
said I’d have had enough in a year. But I haven’t;
and I wouldn’t go back, not if I was paid! I’m sticking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
to the farm all right, so I’m afraid you’ll have to look
elsewhere as long as I’m over sod.”</p>

<p>Wiggie went a little further, looking sadder than
ever.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” he said. “I mean—I’m sorry we
can’t both have it.” And as he vanished under the
hedge, the wistful voice finished its speech—</p>

<p>“I believe I could get well here. I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>A surprising touch of concern startled Harriet as
she heard him, prompting her to call him back to the
rocker and the kitten; but she shook it off with impatient
disgust. He suffered from nerves—anybody
could see that. He lived too much in stuffy rooms
and microbe-ridden railway-carriages, and ate all
the poisonous messes they give you in towns. It
was doubtful, indeed, whether he got enough to eat
at all. His clothes looked prosperous, but he was as
thin as a match; you could hardly see him sideways.
These artist-people had to make a show, so probably
he economised in food. No doubt he smoked excessively
to make up for it—that was why he coughed
and always looked tired. He was thoroughly under
condition altogether, out of training and in a bad way
generally. What he wanted was a stiff walk and a run
with the bassets and ten miles or so on a push-bike;
new milk, good butcher’s meat, and one pipe a week—poor,
weedy rotter! Harriet drew up her own splendidly-working
collection of organisms, and went within
to swing dumb-bells.</p>

<p>And all the way home the voice repeated—as if it
simply couldn’t get away from it: “I believe I could
get well there. I <i>do</i> believe I could! I’m very sorry.”</p>

<p>Bluecaster affairs were keeping Lanty very busy just
at this time, sending him to London more than once,
and otherwise pinning him to his office, so that the
electorate saw little of him and his particular friends
less. His clerk, a young person of enthusiasms,
with a vivid admiration for everything Blue—and
Lancastrian, scamped his meal-hours in order to put
in a little electioneering on his own, but he generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
returned convinced that he had risked his digestion
for nothing. The men he interviewed assured him
that as long as a Lancaster was putting up he could
be certain of their word. Happen they’d vote for
Miss Harriet as well—Mr. Shaw (him over at Watters)
seemed to think they ought to be having her on, and
they weren’t saying but she’d her head set straight
enough on her shoulders for a lass, and they’d all
thought a deal of the old man, and pity there weren’t
a few more like him—but Mr. Lancaster anyhow could
be sure of their cross when the time came—ay, that he
could! But he never got as far as the women, and
indeed he never worried about them at all. The
women always voted for Lanty, because he was young
and unmarried. The clerk had a penchant for the
study of human nature, and rather fancied he knew
all about women—at least, politically. Perhaps he
did; but straws may blow different ways in the same
wind.</p>

<p>The poll opened on a Monday at twelve, but long
before that hour the Watters cars—the limousine,
driven by the chauffeur, and Dandy’s little Delage
cheeping like a scurrying chick behind Hamer in the
touring Austin—were running through the ring of
villages. They made quite an effective little procession,
carrying Stubbs’ old racing colours flying from the
screens, and wonderful placards devised by Hamer:
“Wild Duck Wins!” “Vote for the Old Stock!”
“Help for Harriet!” etc. The candidate, rolling down
the hill in the float five minutes after noon, with no
more ostentation than lay in shining harness in front
of her and a well-trimmed Stubbs at her side, frowned
a little at the flaunting gaiety before the booth; but
objection was impossible in face of Hamer’s joyful
excitement as he hurried to her with outstretched hand.
Thorne’s thin, furtive countenance could be seen
peering round the doorpost for the children he had
stationed at the gate with milkcans labelled “Watered
Wild Duck.” He was puzzled to know why the war-cry
arranged for Harriet’s arrival had missed fire,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
but the reason was not far to seek. On the front seat
of the limousine sat Grumphy, very black and fat and
swathed in ribbon, with a collar of snowdrops round
his neck and a red rose nodding over his ear, smiling
eternally at the wondering childish faces below.</p>

<p>Inside the booth the polling-clerk greeted the lady-farmer
with polite amusement tinged with admiration,
and the early voters, brought in by the Watters contingent,
shook her warmly by the hand. Even Thorne
offered her the same pledge of goodwill, and she
returned it brusquely.</p>

<p>“I doubt you’ll be too much for me, Miss Harriet!”
he remarked, with his thin smile. “You’re so popular,
and those friends of yours have been working terribly
hard. <i>I’ve</i> no cars to fetch folks along to vote for me,
so I must just depend on a little kindly feeling and any
service I may have done the district in all these years.
That may carry me a bit of the way, but I fear it
won’t go far against motors and ribbons!”</p>

<p>“Thorne’s funking you—that’s a sure thing!”
Hamer observed outside. “He’s thinking he’s out of
the game from the start. Lancaster’s certain to go
through—everybody says that—so the Creeping Jesus
has a very thin chance, I’m afraid. Now, Kavanagh,
off you get to Stone Riggs for those almshouse folk—four
of ’em, mind now! Dandy Anne, the Sunflatts
district’s yours; you know how we mapped it out.
I’ll run over to Halfrebeck for that old chap I couldn’t
get a promise from. It might help a bit, Harriet, if
you came along, too. It’s only about a mile.”</p>

<p>Wiggie, who was wearing her colours in his buttonhole,
gave her his seat behind the driver, and hopped
in behind; and, as they slid over the hill, found himself
observing the candidate from a fresh mental
standpoint. There was something new about Harriet,
to-day, that wasn’t to be accounted for by the dark-gray
tailor-made and trim <i lang="fr">suède</i> hat. The impression
of strength, almost of rough power, already familiar,
was now fused with a more courteous dignity and a
nervous self-possession very different from her usual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
sledge-hammer assurance. Memory had leaped upon
her from under a snapped lock, showing her similar crises
in her grandfather’s career. Just so had he said this,
done the other, looked and thought—one of the fine
men a county never quite forgets. It was pretty
fair cheek, perhaps, to think she was fit to follow him.
It would be a rotten turn-out if she made a mess of it.
For all our vaunted superiority, what trembling children
we are, in the first moment of feeling for our fathers’
shoes!</p>

<p>Lanty had arrived by the time they came back,
with the wobbler triumphantly installed in the tonneau,
and shortly afterwards Bluecaster motored down.
Voters were coming in quickly, now, and a cheerful
crowd was collecting round the booth, Helwise’s voice
being easily distinguishable above the rest, as she
informed his lordship that he must certainly call and
see the perfectly sweet “porcelain on legs,” and there
was also just one other little matter of a washhouse
boiler. She had worked him up to offering her an
entire kitchen range when the Watters limousine
groaned round the corner, with four inside, a few
more in front, and Grumphy fatly ensconced within
the luggage-rail; and under cover of its entry he
escaped.</p>

<p>The day wore on, but still the tireless cars ran in
and out, and smiling ladies were dug from dark corners
in strange garments that seldom saw the sun. After
six o’clock the rush quickened again until closing-time
at eight, and then, under the fallen curtain of night,
began the weary wait during the count. The crowd
that had ebbed and flowed all day now drifted back,
and where the motor-lamps flung their rays, familiar
faces stood out whitely. The door of the booth had
shut with a final click as the last strokes from the church
clock died, and the mean face of the Creeping Jesus
had peered out for the last time. The black figures
hung patiently round the railings, while the slow half-hours
spoke over their heads. In the grouped cars
the weary canvassers turned anxious eyes to the one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
bright window of the dark building. Grumphy alone
slumbered soundly, with a fat head laid on the knee
of the yawning chauffeur. It was very chill and dismal,
and the lights ringing the square seemed lost in separate
hollows of gloom. Dandy was sitting in the Austin
with Helwise and Wiggie, exchanging conversation
with the doctor and his wife, who had given them tea;
and the passage of the fateful minutes filled her with
vague depression. Close to the Austin’s lamps her
father was standing with Bluecaster and Lanty’s
clerk, Stubbs leaning against the door, and it struck
her that they all looked worried. The clerk was
talking rapidly in a low voice, hammering in his statements
fist on palm, while Bluecaster nodded assent
from time to time. The shrieking children playing
on the outskirts of the crowd quietened suddenly, and
the clerk’s words came up sharply over the car.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t do to take a thing for granted with the
women! There’s never any getting at what they understand
and what they don’t. You can explain till you’re
black in the face, and then have to start at the beginning
and say it all over again. Why, at the Parish Council
Elections, I’ve known them stick their mark against
every man-jack on the card, though the whole boiling
had been at them telling them they could only vote
for nine! They do other daft things, too—put the
cross half-way between a couple of names, or plump
for the very man they don’t want, thinking it’ll out
him, and then swear afterwards that you told ’em to
do it! I don’t know what sort you breed in Lancashire,
Mr. Shaw, but some of our lot up here want a lot of
looking after. A deal of them don’t bother much
about politics in between election-times, and I’m not
saying they’re any the worse for that; but it makes
it a bit stiff working with them when it comes to the
vote. You’ve got to be dead sure that they know
what you want of them, and then you have to go back
and see that they haven’t got it upside down in the
meantime! I may be wrong, sir, and nobody’s wishing
it harder than myself, but I’m very much afraid that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
you’ve gone and done it, this time, without meaning
to. It’ll be a bad day for Bluecaster, if you have!”</p>

<p>Dandy looked questioningly at Wiggie as their
acquaintances melted into the dark.</p>

<p>“Is there anything wrong? They seem put out,
over there.”</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“I haven’t an idea. I saw Harriet about half
an hour before the poll closed—all three of them have
scarcely stirred out of the place since six o’clock—and
I thought she looked tired and rather white, but it
has been a big ordeal for her, and she’s—well—different
to-day, anyhow. It just entered my head to wonder
whether things were going right. Thorne was somewhere
in the background, looking rather pleased
with himself. They said Harriet’s votes were coming
in like smoke this afternoon, but of course the luck
may have turned since then.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I do hope she won’t be out!” Helwise lamented.
“It will send Stubbs simply running to the White
Lion, and her grandfather will be so disappointed up
in Heaven, or wherever it is Rural District Councillors
go when they’re finished with. Lanty was saying only
yesterday that Lancaster and Knewstubb had represented
Bluecaster for many a long year, so it would be
quite like old times to have the two names going to
the Board together. I’m sure he will be disappointed
if he has to be coupled with Thorne again. Lanty
always gets in, of course. You see, he’s so frightfully
well known. He always gets in.”</p>

<p>Inside the room the last vote fluttered down, the
last figure cut the air, and, at long last, Harriet, white
to the lips, looked up and across at Lancaster. He
smiled as he met her eyes, a smile of franker, kinder
comradeship than he had ever given her, putting out
his hand to her as she passed, and she felt the hot
tears fill and burn her throat. Thorne smiled also,
his own thin, furtive smile. The polling-clerk looked
with some curiosity at all three, as, paper in hand, he
turned to the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>Outside, there was a sharp murmur as the square
of light broke the dark mass of the house, framing
the figure in whose hands lay the will of the people.
Dandy saw the keen face of the Bluecaster clerk
thrust forward like that of a leashed hound, and afterwards
her father’s, braced as if for shock; and then
the far-away voice from the door came thinly over the
heads of the silent crowd.</p>

<table>
<tr><td>Harriet Knewstubb</td><td class="tdr">   104</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ollivant Thorne</td><td class="tdr">      99</td></tr>
<tr><td>Lancelot Lancaster &#160; &#160;</td><td class="tdr">   95</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Through the roar that followed she heard Helwise
burst suddenly into tears, and saw the clerk spin round
on Hamer with a fierce nod and exclamation, his face
flushed violently as if he had been struck. She turned
blindly to the comforting of Helwise, surprised to
find her hands trembling and her own eyes full of tears.
Wigmore slid from the car, and joined the little band
of men as Lancaster came up. He met them with a
cheerful shrug, and they stood in silence while Harriet,
Head of the Poll, spoke her thanks to her supporters.
It was strange to hear her steady, strong English,
devoid of slang adornments—old inhabitants thought
of Grand Old John as they listened—stranger still
to hear her voice quiver as she added her regret at
Mr. Lancaster’s defeat. More than one of her friends
wondered secretly if they were meeting the real Harriet
for the first time. Only Stubbs, shining with happiness,
muttered: “In the family. Always in the family!”
with an uplifting pride worth all the temperance
sermons in the world.</p>

<p>When the cheer had died, Thorne said his few,
plausible, little sentences. His cheer was isolated to a
deliberate section, but he seemed quite satisfied with
it. He had expressed his pleasure that the lady was
to be his partner on the Board, and now he turned to
her, offering a furtive paw with something like real
admiration in his shifty eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>“It’s to be you and me, after all, Miss Harriet!”
he said kindly. “I’m not sorry I interfered in that
milk business, if it’s ended in bringing you to this!”</p>

<p>And John Knewstubb’s granddaughter, whose fine
diction had so recently filled delighted ears, remarked:
“Go to the devil, you Creeping Jesus!” and strode off
into the crowd.</p>

<p>Hamer Shaw laid a hand on Lancaster’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“See here, my boy!” he began, looking old and
troubled in the sharp light. “Your lad here says it’s
my fault they’ve outed you. He says I was so taken
up asking the women to vote for Harriet I forgot to
remind ’em to vote for you, too. He asked at least
ten as they came out, and they all said they’d plumped
for Harriet and that I’d told ’em to! Of course, I
didn’t do anything of the sort, but it’s true enough
I never thought of bothering them about <i>you</i>. Everybody
said you were safe, that the usual crowd always
voted for you. Anything else never entered my head.
Your lad says I was so busy running Harriet I made
them think they could only vote for one candidate.
He says those ten female plumpers could have put
you at the head of the poll. If that’s so, I deserve to
be shot—drowned—anything—as the most interfering
old ass in England!”</p>

<p>Lancaster laughed as cheerfully as he knew how.
Hamer he might deceive, but there were too many
natives round him who knew exactly what he must
be feeling.</p>

<p>“Oh, Garnett’s talking through his hat!” he said
lightly. “They put me out because they were tired
of me and wanted a change; it had nothing to do with
you. Let’s get home. It’s been a long day. Harriet
came out fine, didn’t she? Nothing like the old stuff!
Really, my dear Mr. Shaw, there’s no need to worry.”</p>

<p>“But the female plumpers!” the clerk put in
eagerly, still writhing and bitter.</p>

<p>“Oh, stop it, Garnett!” Lanty frowned, then
softened. The boy’s partisanship was sweet, after all.
“I’m sorry, Jimmy. It’s hard lines on you, after the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
way you slaved for me in your off-time, but it can’t
be helped. As for the women, half of them have forgotten
what they did by the time they get outside
the door.”</p>

<p>The young man opened his lips again, but shut them
at once with an effort. Only, as he turned and groped
for a bicycle leaning somewhere against a tree, Dandy
heard him reviling the female plumpers with bitter
if bated breath, ending with his original statement:
“It never does to take things for granted with a
woman!”</p>

<p>She also heard Stubbs inquiring for Harriet, and
when it appeared that that undutiful daughter had
driven off without him, the stranded parent was
stuffed into the Austin. Bluecaster had taken charge
of the still-sobbing Helwise, murmuring incoherent
consolation in the shape of boilers, and persuaded
Lanty to come with him as well, leaving Armer,
whose groans could be heard all over the square, to
follow with the trap. But first the ex-councillor went
back for a final word with the ex-canvasser.</p>

<p>“It’s really all right!” he said, feeling as sorry for
Hamer as for himself. “I’ve far too much on my hands,
anyhow, and this will ease me a bit. Don’t you think
any more of Garnett’s nonsense. These young ’uns
are always too clever by half. He’s wrong, I tell you—dead
wrong!”</p>

<p>But he knew, and Hamer, looking down at him,
knew that the “young ’un” had been perfectly right.</p>

<p>At Watters, the poor man tried to eat his wife’s
carefully-thought-out supper and could not; and Dandy
played an intricate game with a chicken-wing that was
always on its way to her mouth and never got there,
while Wiggie ate nothing either, in his efforts to keep
Mrs. Shaw from observing the others. They drifted
to a warm hearth, and were presently comforted a
little, but Hamer was still very low when he took his
girl in his arms for her good-night kiss.</p>

<p>“This is the Last Tram, little one!” he said sadly.
“I’ve made a fine mess of it, and I’ll never forgive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
myself. There’ll be no more tramming for Hamer
Shaw!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Soon after eleven o’clock, Harriet, standing at her
window in the dark, caught the shuffling of feet in the
road, and directly afterwards a lusty cheer startled
the sleeping peace of Wild Duck. She knew at once
what it meant. So, in her grandfather’s time, had his
supporters come to seal his victory. She remembered
to this day the thrill of pride with which, as a child,
she had listened to the demonstration, creeping from
her bed to peep at the massed enthusiasts without.
Lighting the lamp, she called to Stubbs and threw up
the window, to meet a second cheer as she came into
sight. Standing there, with her father’s hand on her
shoulder, she thanked them briefly and told them to get
off home, with just the same rough humour that Grand
Old John had used with such effect; and after a final
tribute they withdrew. She went to bed with the
warmth and the pride of it glowing at her heart.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>But in the night she woke and saw the thing that
she had done in all its naked, irrevocable folly, saw
how her stratagem had twisted in her hand, to the
undoing of the man she loved. Power and adulation
were sweet, but real love will have first place even in a
Knewstubb heart. She had meant to-day to draw
them together—deep down she knew that she had had
no other hope but that—and instead it had set them
leagues asunder, probably for ever. She had put herself
in the very place where he could not love her—his
own place. She had cut her throat with her own so
subtle weapon, the clever lady of Wild Duck Hall.
She hid her face in her hands, and wept.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>UNDER THE JUNIPER TREE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hamer’s</span> chairs in the chancel looked very select
and correct. There were four of them on the stone
steps, their fine austerity fittingly framed by the rough
arch. The Vicar gazed at them lovingly, and from
them over the fast-filling building. Carriages and cars
were lining up busily at the lych-gate, dropping an
audience drawn from every side of the district. Things
looked promising for the Missions over the Seas; even
for the K.O.s.</p>

<p>The Bluecaster Choral Society, numbering over sixty,
was packed tightly into the choir-stalls, with a surplus
of men on forms. Late comers were greeted with
despairing shakes of the head, and stood about in the
aisle, looking lost, but in a minute or two they had
always miraculously disappeared, stowed away somewhere
in the serried ranks. The chancel had been
partially decorated in honour of the occasion, and
through the fronds of palm and fern could be traced
exotic blooms of mystifying shape and colour, appearing
presently as ladies’ hats. There was a good deal
of whispered conversation in progress—the sort that
misses your neighbour’s ear but can be heard well
across the aisle—and a fluttering of leaves like a fretted
wind up an autumn glade. Hymn-books and direction-papers
were being handed about, and anxious-looking
tenors stood up and signalled to worried-looking basses.
The male portion of a choir is always economical of
concentration. No matter how its part in the programme
has been explained, it will generally wait to
wonder about things until the stick is well up on the
opening beat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>A twin fluttering was going on in the congregational
forest, and feathers and fur bent towards each other
in the throes of lowered comment. So Nancy Leyburne
<i>was</i> going to be the soprano—the Widow—after all!
A little pointed, surely—curious, anyhow—so soon
after her broken engagement! And really it was a
shocking pity that Graham-Langwathby insisted upon
considering himself a tenor, when it was perfectly
plain to anybody—anybody <i>musical</i>—that he was
simply a pushed-up baritone. They might have been
sure he would be the Obadiah. You met him at every
old thing—like other people’s clothes.</p>

<p>“The Angel—oh, my dear, <i>do</i> remember you’re in
church!—the Angel, ‘Fidge’ Morseby! Let me see—was
it <i>last</i> night I saw her on the luggage-carrier of
Captain Gaythorne’s motor-cycle? And at the Gaythornes’
theatricals—well, perhaps I <i>had</i> better wait
till we get home.”</p>

<p>“Who’s the Elijah?—something Wigmore—C. or
G.? Oh, I believe he’s a friend of the new Watters
people. I seem to have heard of him—the only one
of their old set that they weren’t able to choke off.
Colossal cheek to tackle a big thing like ‘Elijah,’ but
perhaps he thinks it doesn’t matter here. It’s really
very distressing how little outsiders realise our extremely
high standard of culture!”</p>

<p>Hamer and his wife were in a convenient position
for admiring both their own chairs and their daughter’s
head through the palms. Helwise was at the extreme
end of a stall under the reading-desk, just where her
wandering soprano would sail straight into Wiggie’s
sensitive ear. There was a pretty colour in her delicate
cheeks. She had just been having words with the
Vicar about the necessity of providing his best silk
drawing-room cushions for the unyielding oak seats of
Hamer’s property. Harriet was in the altos. If you
are not quite sure whether you possess a voice or not,
they always shove you into the altos, or else into that
last refuge of the destitute—the second trebles.</p>

<p>Bluecaster was talking to Lanty in the porch when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
a long gray car, covered with mud, slid up to the gate,
setting down a young man, thin and eager-looking,
and an older one, broad-shouldered and dark, with
sad eyes. They were evidently strangers, from the
way they looked about them, and in the porch the
thin man appealed for information.</p>

<p>“I understand there is to be a performance of the
‘Elijah,’ this afternoon. Shall we find seats, do
you think? We’ve come some distance to hear a
friend sing.”</p>

<p>Bluecaster took them in tow and persuaded the
verger to put them in the Vicar’s pew in front, the
Vicar’s wife being securely jammed in the chancel
sardine-box. The strangers looked tired, as if they
had come far, and they talked to each other in little,
snapped-off, troubled sentences. Once, the hatchet-faced
man rose as if set on an errand, but the big
man dragged him down again. His voice was low,
but singularly penetrating, on account of its curious
inflections.</p>

<p>“It’s no good. You can’t make a fuss, with this
crowd. He would never forgive us. Sit still, man,
and trust to Heaven. You’ll have the congregation
thinking we’re the bailiffs!”</p>

<p>In the vestry, the Bluecaster schoolmaster, an excitable
little man with a beat like an aeroplane propeller,
was giving the last instructions to his soloists. The
Obadiah was making quite sure of his moustache in
the clerical looking-glass, while the Angel, in the very
latest of earthly fashions, followed Wiggie round the
room, declaiming: “Elijah! Get thee hence, Elijah!”
with playful fervour. The Widow looked out of the
window, rather sad and pale, and to her Wiggie drifted
by degrees. She was young and evidently very
nervous, and because she had blue eyes rather like
Dandy’s, he wanted to speak to her; so he opened his
neat, leather-bound copy, asking how she meant to
take a certain phrase.</p>

<p>As he closed it again, she caught the name on the
cover, and gave a little cry, putting out her hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>“It <i>was</i>! I knew it was! I heard you——”</p>

<p>Wiggie grabbed the hand and squeezed it, he was
so anxious to stop her. The conductor looked round
hurriedly.</p>

<p>“Thought you were going to cry or have hysterics,
Miss Leyburne! Don’t be nervous. You’ll feel as
right as rain the minute you hear the first note of your
beautiful voice. (I think everything is ready, now,
so we can go in.) Look at Mr. Wigmore there, as easy
as you like!”</p>

<p>Elijah smiled politely. His hands were icy, and his
heart was beating in great, wavering bumps, but that
had nothing to do with the conductor.</p>

<p>“He’s wrong, isn’t he?” the Widow whispered—she
had touched his hand—and he nodded.</p>

<p>“It’s my belief you don’t do anything great if
you’re not frightened beforehand. A self-possessed
performer may get at an audience’s admiration, but
it takes the inside-frightened person to get at their
hearts. It’s like going into battle—the trembling
Tommy hits hardest when he starts.”</p>

<p>Seated at last under the reading-desk palm, with
the Angel beside him, the sea of faces so near seemed
to rise and engulf him, turning him faint. His heart
still hammered its wavering stroke, like a bad workman.
It was a blessing Gardner could not hear it—Gardner
in London; though it was almost a wonder,
it thumped so loudly.</p>

<p>And then he saw Gardner, with his hatchet-face
over the pew-front as if he meant to leap it—Gardner
and the other dear old watchdog!—and the sickening
nervousness changed to a freakish joy, a mischievous
delight. Edgar looked upset; he had forgotten poor
old Edgar. There were the children, too—but it
didn’t do to think of them. Edgar would understand.
He would have done the same himself. He sent a
brilliant smile to the men in the front pew, a smile
so gaily defiant that Lancaster, far behind, wondered.
The organist played the first of the four big chords,
but he was too busy smiling to heed, until the Angel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
nudged him, alarmed. But, once up, he forgot the
watchdogs, forgot the palm tickling his ear, forgot
even the children of whom he would not think. He
was Elijah, flinging out his mighty message to a
cowering people.</p>

<p>During his long wait following, he did not look at
the audience again. They did not matter any more.
The big thing that was happening was not on their
side of the building. Most of the time he sat with his
eyes on the well-known notes, but when he turned
ever so little to the right, he could see Dandy singing
with every inch of her, her rapt gaze fixed on the
whirling beat. How the Dandy Shaw of Halsted would
have scoffed, not unkindly, but with sincere amusement,
at such rustic enthusiasm! He saw an admiring
young joiner offer her a paper bag when the close air
caught her throat during Obadiah’s pushed-up solo,
and watched her abstract the offering without a qualm.
Absurd details like these were little wind-arrows,
pointing the trackless way along which she was drifting,
further and further from him.</p>

<p>All the delinquencies and hiatuses of the plucky
little chorus smote his trained ear in a succession of
torturing shocks. He knew when the infant basses
asked for bread exactly half a bar too late, and heard
Helwise calling upon Baal to listen at a moment
when she had no business to be singing at all. Through
all the shades of alto he could detect a queer grumbling
like that of a home-sick cow, and traced it correctly
to Harriet. Yet you could not have told from his
face that the Second Tenor Angel had dashed his foot
against several stones in the way of accidentals, though
the conductor moaned and wept, and knocked a mauve
hat eastwards in one of his volplaning movements.
The professional knew so much better than anybody
else just what was the real standard of the big work,
and the long rehearsal of the night before had set him
marvelling at the perseverance which had brought it
into presentable form. He had been told the miles
the choir came through wild weather, opening his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
eyes at the record of attendance; and when he had
grasped their deeds achieved, in face of the average
of knowledge among them, he saw each member a
Hercules striving to seventy times seven, and the little
aeroplaning schoolmaster a hero storming Valhalla.</p>

<p>The Widow trembled to her feet, and Wiggie guessed
that there were real tears behind the first words of
pleading for the sick child. He got up presently, long
before his time, and stood beside her to give her
courage; and when he broke at last into the thrice-repeated,
conquering prayer, with eyes fixed on a
far window, unheeding the woman’s interjected lament,
it seemed to the girl, bitterly conscious of her personal
trouble, that it was her own spirit, her own future,
that he gave back alive again into her hands.</p>

<p>But, curiously enough, it was not the praying but
the fighting Elijah that Wiggie loved best. The pale,
diffident young man saw himself as the fierce, tanned
herald of woe, and made others see him as such, too.
It was glorious to curse kings, run before chariots
and slay false prophets by the hundred! He felt the
inspired words hot on his lips, the racing blood in his
veins, the warm dust spurned by his swift feet. In
the great “hammer” solo he worked to such a pitch
of intensity, beating out the last iron strokes of the
<i lang="it">più lento</i> so strongly that the audience almost winced
beneath his power, and the hatchet-faced man shook
like a whippet on leash, uttering sharp little sounds
remarkably like oaths. But after that—after the
Reproach to Ahab—Elijah sank back into Wigmore,
quivering under the virulent words of the venomous
Queen as if they had been live blades. The Queen
was a strenuous member of the Society, with a bludgeon
air that reminded him of Harriet, and he shrank before
her condemnation as he had shrunk many a time under
Harriet’s scorn. The tired protest under the juniper-tree,
in face of the fresh task—“Oh, Lord, I have
laboured in vain! Yea, I have spent my strength,
have spent my strength for naught. O that I now
might die!” brought the tears chasing down Hamer’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
cheeks, but it was Wiggie, not Elijah, who brought
them there, though he did not know it. It was Wiggie’s
own cry from a desolate heart and an almost finished
body, looking into a future void of the one hope that
had kept him alive for long—the terrible cry of the
human, seeing the strength of the flesh break, taking
the strength of the soul with it. He was in the wilderness,
and no God could set his feet for Horeb.</p>

<p>But the pitiful personal note was felt, if not recognised,
bringing the Angel to “O Rest in the Lord” with a
style very different from her famous “Sing me to
Sleep” imitation, and aweing the basses to an unwonted
mellowness of mumbling in the tender balm of “He
that shall Endure to the End.” And at the close of it,
the quiet figure on Hamer’s chair lifted his eyes and
smiled the same whimsical smile at the strangers in
the front pew. The man with the sad eyes smiled
also. The leashed whippet sank back and was still.</p>

<p>It was over at last, the last brave spurt of confidence
and hope, the swirl of the final choruses, followed by
the stillness of a prayer; and then the organ burst out
again, the doors flew open, the sardine-box unpacked
itself and stretched. A hum of wonder was running
through the congregation. <i>Who</i> was the collapsed
young man with the perfect voice at least six sizes too
big for him? Quite extraordinarily good, and with a
great look of—something like “Quagga”—the man
who was commanded to Windsor last month—but
of course they all knew that he was nothing more
exciting than the Shaws’ last, unthrottled-off pal.</p>

<p>Wiggie saw the watchdogs spring up and leave the
pew, to be checked at their first step by the Vicar’s
wife, strongly suspicious that they had been sitting on
her best Prayer-book; and as the stream from the
chancel joined the human sea below, he seized the
opportunity to escape from the adoring conductor,
and steer his swimming head towards the vestry door.
Here the Vicar had his word, but at last he was out
on the step and in the air; and there he found Harriet.</p>

<p>“Saw you bolt for the vestry,” she began, “so I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
came round outside, as I wanted to speak to you.
I say, you <i>did</i> do us all proud! Hefty sort of song,
that hammer-yell—what? You must be stronger
than you look, to put all that weft into it. By the
way, there’s a couple of outsiders waiting at the
lych-gate, asking for you. I suppose they didn’t see
you bunk for the short cut. Look here! Will you
play hockey for me, to-morrow?”</p>

<p>He gazed at her with the patient surprise of one,
half-crossed to the other world, surveying the caperings
of those still firmly anchored to this. At that moment
he could not have run from one tombstone to the next,
and a hockey-ball, bounding down the path, would
have taken to itself a dozen nebulous brethren under
his reeling sight. Except in the case of her own employees,
who were rigidly well looked after, Harriet,
with her superb health, rarely troubled about other
people’s, unless they were yellow with jaundice or pink
with scarlet fever. And she had already decided what
was the right treatment for Wiggie.</p>

<p>“I haven’t played for years,” he hedged, “so I
should be worse than useless. And I’m afraid I’ve—a—a
very bad headache!” he added apologetically.</p>

<p>“No wonder! The atmosphere in there was enough
to lift the roof clean off its hinges. But your head will
have gone by to-morrow, won’t it? As for being out
of training, it doesn’t matter; at least, it <i>does</i> matter,
but it can’t be helped. You can always get in the way
and let the ball hit you. Every little helps. It’s
Dandy’s fault. She was one of the team, and now
she and her folks are scuttling off to that Motor and
Aero Show to-morrow. Don’t say you’re going with
them, because you can’t. They’ll let you stop on by
yourself, won’t they? You might help me out of a
hole—especially as it’s Dandy’s hole. We’re up against
a classy team, so I don’t want to be short. I ought
to have a girl, of course, but I don’t suppose Witham
will mind our playing a man extra, as it’s only you.”</p>

<p>Wiggie pondered, expecting every minute to see
the watchdogs round the corner, and felt again that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
frivolous longing for a last snap of the fingers in the
relentless face of Fate. He had been a keen player
in his early twenties, before the Moloch of music clasped
him in its searing arms. There had even been international
visions, at one time. It would be rather fun
to feel the ugly old stick again, jumping and ready
under his hand, to put out a foot in the path of the
whizzing ball and nurse it neatly up the hugged touch-line.
Of course, he couldn’t possibly last more than
five minutes, and Harriet would be extremely angry
if he went and died suddenly in front of a clean clearing-shot,
but he wanted those five minutes very badly.
Moreover, for some curious reason, he had never been
able to disobey Harriet’s mandates. He did things
for Dandy because it was as natural as eating and
sleeping, not in the least because he felt he had to;
but he was always conscious that Harriet was pushing
him, and he seldom tried to resist, for, deep down
somewhere in his drifting soul, was a queer sense of
comfort in being pushed.</p>

<p>“Togs?” he asked weakly, and Harriet’s face
brightened.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lanty will rig you out! He’s got all the
necessary kit stowed away somewhere, if Helwise
hasn’t shifted it to the nearest rummage-sale. I’ll
tell him you’ll send over for it in the morning, if you
don’t see him yourself. I say—it’s jolly decent of
you! Hope you don’t really mind missing the old
’buses? It makes all the difference to <i>me</i>; and the
fresh air will do you no end of good—you take my
word for it!—that, and a bit of hopping about.
D’you suppose those friends of yours are still kicking
their heels? Perhaps they’re wanting to cocker you
about the hammer-yell. Oughtn’t you to be scouting
round?”</p>

<p>“They’re not friends,” Wiggie answered absently—he
was trying to remember that neat little twist of
the stick-point that had been such a favourite of his—“they’re
police. At least, I mean——” He stammered,
catching her surprised eye. “I say, my head is really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
rather bad! I think I’ll take the path across the
fields, and miss everybody. You might shunt the—the
friends for me, captain, and whisper a word in
Hamer’s ear!”</p>

<p>“Right-o!” She swerved off with a nod as he
opened the little gate and fled across the green to the
stile in the opposite wall. There he heard her hail
him a second time, just as he was stepping into safety.</p>

<p>“You know where the ground is, I suppose? The
big meadow just below Wild Duck. Don’t forget.
Bully-off at 2.30, <i>sharp</i>!”</p>

<p>He stood a moment with a foot on the hollowed
stone. The feel of the farm came back to him, and
the rocker, and the furry cat. He was glad the ground
was just there—wherever it was. If he might not live
at Wild Duck, he might at least, when the match was
over, go and die in it.</p>

<p>He kept close to the hedge until he was safely out of
the danger zone, like a hare lying low in its form for
the wind to bring news of the pack. He began to
feel a little better in the cool and the quiet, and the
same mischievous excitement crept upon him that
had roused at the sight of Gardner’s face. He would
have a good run for his money, wherever it ended,
but he must be careful, or the watchdogs would nab
him before he was ready. For all he knew, they might
be at Watters when he got there, which would be more
than awkward. He must keep out of their way until
he had stood long enough in front of a hockey-ball
to please Harriet, even if he had to tell lies to do it.
He wondered whether lies counted when you were
finishing with everything, and breaking all the foolish
little threads of life, or whether a special concession
was made by the Angel of the Judgment, just as, in
some fatal illnesses, you may eat anything that you
fancy, because nothing can possibly harm you ever
any more. He laughed a little. It was all quite
amusing, and he wondered why he had felt so dismal
under the juniper-tree. But of course he hadn’t
remembered then just how that neat little point-twist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
snatched the ball from under an opponent’s nose.
He pulled a stick out of the hedge, and began to practise
with it, and when he found the old turn still oiled after
all these years, he laughed again, and a farm lad
heard him over the fence, and confided to his dog that
there was somebody on the loose “as mun sewerly be
a bit wrang in t’ garrets!”</p>

<p>At Watters there was no sign of the long gray car,
but he reconnoitred carefully before committing himself
to the prisoning of four walls. Dandy was a little
bit hurt because he had elected to walk home alone,
escaping all laudation. She was very excited about
the performance, and perfectly convinced that it must
have been faultless in every detail, seeing that she
herself hadn’t sung a single wrong note from beginning
to end. But her momentary chagrin vanished at sight
of the star’s drawn face, and she pushed him into a
chair and brought him tea, comforting him with
pleasant little words of praise. He received her attentions
without protest because he was still thinking
about that point-twist, and practised it mentally with
the teaspoon.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to take a long rest, Cyril, my boy!”
Hamer said kindly. “You must have to raise a deal
of steam to keep that rock-breaking business going
up to time. It made me feel sore inside, just watching
you breathe! It can’t be good for you, to my way
of thinking. You’ll please just keep quiet for a bit,
or we’ll have you going to pieces altogether.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll soon be having a lot of quiet!” Wiggie
answered cheerfully, twiddling the spoon. (He wondered
whether they would think him silly if he asked
to have a hockey-stick buried with him. Working
out a new point-twist would put him on nicely until
the Judgment.) “You know, I haven’t any more
engagements for a long time.” (He hoped they
wouldn’t collar him at once for the Heavenly Choir.
He would like to sit and listen for a bit, and hear
somebody else getting up steam for a change.) “I’m
glad I had ‘Elijah’ as the final bust-up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>“Why, you talk as though you never meant to sing
again!” Dandy exclaimed curiously. “You <i>do</i> look
tired, Wiggie dear! I feel anxious about you. Don’t
you think you’d better stop here quietly, to-morrow,
and just lounge about and do nothing, instead of coming
up to the Show? I’m sure you’re not fit for a hard
day, and we’d be back at night, you know, so you
wouldn’t be alone for long.”</p>

<p>This suggestion was loudly encored by both parents,
and Mrs. Shaw offered to stay down with him, but
Hamer wouldn’t hear of it.</p>

<p>“No, no, Mother! We know what you and Cyril
are when you get together. He’d be carrying jam-pots
for you, or reading your crochet-patterns and
singing you little snooze-tunes when he ought to be
resting. He’ll be best alone, brutal as it sounds.”</p>

<p>“It will be horrid, leaving you behind!” Dandy
added regretfully, and Wiggie felt a little spasm of
happy warmth, and then a little twinge of shame
because he was going to deceive these kind souls so
completely. He grasped the teaspoon a little tighter,
and tried not to care. It would be no use trying
to make them understand how impossible it was to
disobey Harriet.</p>

<p>“I forgot to tell you I heard two men asking for
you,” Dandy went on. “They were sitting in the
front pew—perhaps you noticed them? They wanted
to know the way to Watters, and just as I was thinking
of telling them you belonged to us, Harriet came up
and said you’d gone to the station to meet the 4.45.
I was so taken aback that I missed my opportunity,
and let them escape, and when I tried to get at Harriet,
to ask her what she meant, she just nodded and disappeared.
I’m afraid she’s dreadfully vexed about
the hockey-match. I hope she’ll get somebody all
right. <i>Did</i> you go to the station, Wiggie, or was I
dreaming? I suppose you don’t know who the men
are? They’ll probably come on here, I should think,
if they didn’t find you.”</p>

<p>“Probably!” Wiggie agreed. “Oh yes, I think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
I know them all right. They want to worry me about
something, and I don’t think I could stand being
bullied to-night. They’re terribly difficult people to
get rid of, any time. Don’t you think we might tell
them to call again?”</p>

<p>“In the morning,” she suggested, “just for a few
minutes before you begin your nice, quiet day? How
would that do? We’re starting before nine, you know,
so I’m afraid we shan’t be here to protect you, but
we’ll leave Blenkinship’s Marget in charge. She’s
very brave with all the one-foot-on-the-mat people,
and she’ll simply stand on her head for a chance of
nursing somebody, so I do hope you’ll lie on the sofa
and let her bring you beaten-up eggs and things.”</p>

<p>“And treacle-posset? I love treacle-posset!”
Wiggie murmured happily, then got up quickly,
dropping the teaspoon. He had heard a car turn
in at the gate. “May I go and see her about it
now?”</p>

<p>But instead of seeing Marget, he slid silently through
the old gun-room into the stable-yard, and shinned up
the Jacob’s Ladder in the loose box to the loft above,
and sat on a rusty old turnip-chopper and shivered
in the dark until there had been time to rout the
enemy’s attack. It was Dandy who caught Blenkinship’s
Marget in the hall, and whispered instructions
that set that warlike damsel yearning for battle.
She was a little surprised to find two quite pleasant,
if rather tired and troubled gentlemen on the doorstep,
but her orders were definite. Yes, Mr. Wigmore had
been in, and gone out again, leaving word for them
to call and see him at eleven o’clock in the morning.
Well, could they see the master, Mr. Shaw, or say,
Mrs. Shaw, if there was one? They couldn’t. The
master was up to his ears in letters for the post, and
as to whether there was a mistress or not, that was
none of <i>their</i> business! How <i>was</i> Mr. Wigmore?
Alive and kicking, if they cared to know, and fit to
stick up for himself against anybody, any day. No,
they couldn’t come in and wait. They’d lost two silver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
candlesticks off the hall-table, that way, already—but
they might leave cards if they had such things—considered
doubtful. However, the cards were forthcoming,
and the disappointed callers drew back on
their tracks. Watters had received them odiously
altogether. They had found difficulty in turning into
the drive, to begin with, and, when once safely through,
had nearly run into a wheelbarrow that some idiot
had left in the middle of it. Then they had been
allowed to shiver unregarded on the step, and afterwards
treated with contumely. The gate that had
refused to open when they entered, swung heavily
on their tail-lamp as they drove out. Decidedly, this
wasn’t their day.</p>

<p>Blenkinship’s Marget, studying the cards with
interest, found Wiggie at her shoulder, and handed
them over, though under protest. “They said as
they were for t’ master,” she explained, but Wiggie
only smiled and began to talk about treacle-possets.
It was just as well that Hamer shouldn’t see those
cards.</p>

<p>Everybody was very kind to him, that evening,
and thought he should not only have a nice, quiet day
following, but a nice, quiet night straight away, so
he was packed off to bed soon after dinner was over.
As he crossed the hall to the foot of the stairs—very
slowly, for he was afraid of the night—Dandy came
out of the smoke-room to meet him. She looked
singularly radiant, he thought, from the depths of
his own chill fear. Beyond, he could hear Hamer at
the telephone.</p>

<p>“You’re going up? That’s right!” she said with
a relieved air. People always think things are going
to straighten themselves out when they have persuaded
you to do something unpleasant. She gave him
her hand with a kindly pressure. “Are you sure you
have everything you want? Isn’t there <i>really</i> something
more we can give you or do for you? You’ve
had such a fearfully hard day, and you’re so tired!
And, look here, you must promise—promise faithfully,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
or I won’t let you go—that if you feel bad in the
morning you’ll let us know, first thing. I’d never
forgive myself if we went off for a day’s pleasure,
leaving you to be ill all alone.” She wrinkled her
brow, looking at him very earnestly. “I sometimes
wonder, Wiggie, whether you tell us all the truth.
You never do talk much about yourself, do you?
We know who you <i>are</i>, of course, and we’ve been
friends for years, but you never tell us your troubles,
and though you always say there’s nothing the matter
with you that matters, I don’t think I quite believe
it. You look so”—she laughed rather shakily, and
put a comforting hand on his arm—“so dreadfully
‘gone before!’ Don’t you know how precious you
are to us all, Wiggie dear? Let us have a chance of
taking care of you if you really need it, won’t you?”</p>

<p>With his own hands tightly clasped on the banister,
he stood looking down into her eyes, and at her hair,
tossed into a mesh of gold by the little watchman’s
lamp at the foot of the stair, at the pleading mouth
and the pearls at her throat, at the whole, terrible,
beautiful want in his life that she represented, and
an impulse came over him to tell her the truth, and
see the mouth quiver, and the tears so near the surface
brim over for his sorry plight. He had always taken
care of <i>her</i>, thought for <i>her</i>, lived for <i>her</i>, but perhaps
she had had help for him, too, all the time. If he
broke now, completely and in utter thankfulness,
would he find himself, if only for a little, within the
comfort of her arms?</p>

<p>The telephone rang off, and instantly, as if snatched
by a cord, Dandy dropped her hand and turned, her
lips opened to an unspoken question as Hamer came
into the hall with a pleased expression on his face.
He nodded to her as he advanced.</p>

<p>“Not gone yet, Cyril? Come, now, be a good lad,
and get tucked up! The missis is still set on stopping
behind, but I tell her she’ll only fuss you. I’ve got
Lancaster persuaded to come, Dandy Anne! He hung
fire for some time, talked about work and umpiring a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
hockey-match, but I made him promise to cry off and
join us. I’m talking of to-morrow, Cyril. I had an
idea at dinner. As you’re a bit under the wind, I’ve
asked Lancaster to come along in your place.”</p>

<p>Wiggie moved a few steps up the stair.</p>

<p>“Glad you thought of it! And awfully glad he’ll
go! He doesn’t give himself a day off very often.
Hope you’ll have a first-class time, all the lot of you!”
He glanced at Dandy, thrilling with a happy excitement
she could not repress. (No, he had no right,
there.) “Sleep well, Dandy Anne, and don’t worry
your dear head. I’ll be as fit as ever, after my nice,
quiet day.”</p>

<p>Inside his silent lavender room with the rosy curtains,
he found a well-groomed spink sitting on the
rail of his bed. It cocked its head on one side when
he closed the door behind him, and they surveyed
each other with interest. Harriet had said that birds
in your room meant disaster, and Harriet was always
right. He had thought, for a moment—one crowned,
delirious moment on the stair—that Harriet would
not find him at her hockey-match, after all, but Fate
did not mean him to fail her. Lancaster was going
to the Show. Lancaster would have his place in the
car. Very well! Let Lancaster have his Show and
his seat, and his share of Life Everlasting. <i>He</i> would
have his five little minutes of the point-twist.</p>

<p>He laughed aloud as he had done in the fields,
scaring the bird from its perch, and after a minute or
two he caught it deftly in his thin fingers. How frail
it felt! he thought, as he opened the window and
tossed it lightly into the night. Would the Almighty
find him just so, he wondered—a piteous, frightened
heart beating the walls of its fragile tenement—when
His Fingers closed softly round him for the last, light
fling into the Dark?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br>

<small>WIGGIE’S FIVE MINUTES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was still scarcely day when he heard the house
rouse to action, and dragged his miserable body out
of bed for a look at the weather. He had not slept
much—most of the night he had been toying with an
imaginary hockey-stick in a dull stupor—but every
time he had waked to acute consciousness he had
been certain that the rain was dripping heavily down
the pane. He would have been bitterly disappointed
if Harriet’s hockey-match had been frustrated, and
that little ecstasy of five minutes had slipped his reach.
But he might have remembered that Harriet always
got everything she wanted—almost everything; little
things like weather and Rural District Councillorships,
anyhow. And certainly it was not raining now,
though the brightening earth had a watery look which
would be dried presently from its clean, green face,
sparkling through its veil of soft, gray air, and clothed
around with the dark zone of wood. It was going to
be just the right sort of day for hockey, with the
ground springy and true, and the air soft but strong,
and all the little spring-voices calling to you as you
line up, light and free. He wondered what sort of a
stick Lanty would be able to find him, and hoped it
wouldn’t be a Bulger. You wanted something lighter
and whippier to bring that point-twist off properly.
But of course it <i>would</i> be a Bulger. It was just the
right sort of steady whacker for a respectable person
like a land agent, playing back. He was absolutely
certain Lancaster had played back. He always
seemed to be behind things, somehow, on guard and
keeping watch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>Then he heard Hamer’s voice in the passage, and
realised suddenly that he was very cold, and the bed
a terribly long way off. However, he got back there
all right, and was busily reminding himself about the
nice, quiet day, and trying not to think of the Bulger,
when Hamer knocked and entered. How was he?
Oh, topping, thanks! Just a bit tired, though.
Hoped they’d excuse him for not showing to see them
off. Would get up after a bit and have a nice, quiet
breakfast. It was awfully decent of them to think
they would miss him, but he was sure the Show
atmosphere would have bowled him over at once.
He hoped Hamer would buy that motor lawn-roller
they were advertising. It would save the gardeners
a lot of work, and he might lend it to Harriet, perhaps,
for the hock—well, why on earth shouldn’t he say
“hockey-ground”? The motor-roller kept his host
off the guest’s health for the next five minutes, and by
that time the car was at the door.</p>

<p>He had handled Hamer rather artistically, he thought,
sinking back with somewhat weary satisfaction, and
then came Dandy’s fingers drumming lightly on the
panel.</p>

<p>Was he better? <i>Sure</i> he was better? If he didn’t
say it more convincingly than that, nothing on earth
would induce her to leave him. She wasn’t half-certain
she wanted to go, as it was! But it was going to be
a lovely day, and she loved the long run, and of
course she loved the aeroplanes and the lovely, big
cars—</p>

<p>“In fact, God’s in His Heaven, and no doubt about
it, my lovely dear!” Wiggie observed sadly to his
sorry self, and, because the panel was between them,
put into his hearty wish for her day’s happiness all
the melody of the beautiful things he would never
say to her now as long as she lived. And then there
came the pulsing roar of the car beneath his window,
throttled down after to a steady purr, and the big
wheels gripped the drive and slurred off and out into
the distance. He lay in bed, listening to the sudden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
silence of the house, and feeling in every nerve the
desolation of being left behind.</p>

<p>After an argument—carried on, it seemed, independently
of his own brain—between a body which
flatly refused to arise, and something brandishing
threats with faces like Harriet’s—he found the body
dressed and at breakfast, by some curious conjuring,
and feeling a little braver and bigger by virtue of a
large bath, strong coffee and the bright morning.
Blenkinship’s Marget waited on him with ardent
devotion, and he began hastily to lay his evil plans,
seeing sofa-cushions and beaten-up eggs quite plainly
in her yearning eye. With a royal air he ordered the
limousine and the under-chauffeur for ten minutes to
eleven.</p>

<p>Blenkinship’s Marget stared, as well she might, for
although she knew that everything at Watters was
entirely at Mr. Wigmore’s service, down to the last
salt-spoon, he had never so much as ordered a wheelbarrow
before. Wiggie read the newspaper upside
down, and tried not to look as though he knew she
was staring.</p>

<p>“I thought you’d to keep quiet, sir, to-day, if you’ll
excuse my mentioning it,” she ventured at last, “and
you’re looking that poorly, it fair makes my heart
ache! There’s them two gents., too, as was to call
at eleven. You’ll just miss them.”</p>

<p>“No, Marget, I shall not!” he replied firmly. “I
shall meet them on the road, and so you will be saved
answering the bell. And we shall both be saved having
to throw them out of the house, because they will
never be inside it. You can’t say it isn’t keeping quiet
to sit perfectly still on a padded seat while things
called spiggots and stub-axles and tappets and gudgeon-pins
pull you along. And I’m looking poorly this
morning because you didn’t bring me that treacle-posset
you promised, yesterday. You can’t expect
me to be very hearty and blooming after screaming
with hunger all night.”</p>

<p>Marget looked conscience-stricken, and then brightened.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
The treacle-posset might atone in some measure
for the lack of egg-and-sofa treatment.</p>

<p>“You shall have it this evening, sir, honest and
faithful! I thought it was only your bit of joke.
Then you’ll see the gents., sir?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll certainly <i>see</i> them!” Wiggie promised
cheerfully. “And look here, Marget, if they come
worrying again to the house and make out they
haven’t met me, just pretend you’re all dead or something,
will you, and keep on keeping out of the way?
I’ve to have a nice, quiet day, you know—master’s
orders!”</p>

<p>And see them he did, meet them he did, quite five
minutes before their time, just as the limousine had
cleared Watters and settled down into the straight.
But it is quite easy to see and yet not be seen in a
closed car with a deep back seat, and at the wheel an
enthusiastic under-chauffeur, blessed with the Heaven-sent
chance of “letting her rip.” Wiggie was over
at Crabtree asking for garments by the time the “two
gents.” had finished knocking and peering at an
apparently deserted house. As they were leaving, in
intense irritation and disgust, they met a gardener’s
boy, who told them that the whole family had gone to
the Show. Which Show? “Why, t’ gert ’un i’ Manchester,
o’ coorse!” Mr. Wigmore, too? Yes, certainly
Mr. Wigmore, too. The gardener’s boy was
always at least twenty-four hours behind the clock,
so his knowledge of Wiggie’s indisposition was not
due for some time yet.</p>

<p>The wily quarry found Helwise in the attic, hunting
for the shirt and shorts that she had assured Lanty
were safe in the green ottoman on the front landing.
She had believed her own statement quite honestly,
and as Lancaster was in a hurry, he believed he believed
it, too, which he would not have done in a calmer
moment, but no amount of belief had conjured the
garments into the ottoman. Wiggie joined in the
search with zest, and though it was not Wiggie’s attic,
it was certainly Wiggie who suggested twenty hiding-places<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
and discovered the treasure in the twenty-first.
And after Lanty’s hockey-stick had been run to earth
in the jam-cupboard, it was nearly lunch-time, so at
Miss Lancaster’s request the borrower stayed to join
her at the scrapings of something potted. She was
driving over to the match in any case, so he sent the
car home and changed in Lanty’s room. He fell
asleep by the dining-room fire while he was waiting
for Helwise to decide whether she looked more sporting
in her own golf jersey or Lanty’s aquascutem, and
dreamed he was the sparking-plug in a very large
motor-roller at the Show, over which Dandy’s face
was bent in earnest struggle after comprehension.
Hamer had bought the motor-roller, and wished to
see it roll something, if only a little Manchester mud,
so it was trotted out and set to work, and then everything
went to smithereens in a hundred and forty
different directions, and he could hear Dandy’s voice,
far and very far off, remarking: “Something wrong
with the sparking-plug! I knew it last night on the
stairs!”</p>

<p>He woke gasping and clutching at things, and if
Helwise (in Lanty’s ’scutem) had been anybody but
Helwise, she would have rung all the bells and ordered
doctors and hot bottles and brandy, but instead she
asked him to button her gloves, and thought him
tiresomely stupid and fumbling as she tried to see
exactly how sporting she looked in the sideboard
mirror.</p>

<p>He felt better again, however, as they jogged along
to the ground, and began to experience joyful thrills
as strenuous figures with bare knees and flapping
overcoats push-biked past them, armed with sticks.
He drew his own from under the rug so that the push-bikers
could see it. It was a Bulger, as he had anticipated,
slightly elegantised by wear and tear, but a
Bulger for all that. Still, it might possibly bring off
the twist all right, if he hurried it a bit.</p>

<p>The field under the farm was already dotted by the
red shirts of the opposing team, and a sprinkling of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
spectators edged the neat touch-lines. The white-topped
Bluecastrians were grouped beside the little
pigeon-house of a pavilion (where at least two people
who liked each other might have found room to shelter)
listening to Harriet’s barked directions. When the
trap drove up, she looked at a very strong watch on
her wrist so emphatically that Helwise tried to leap
the wheel, and tore Lanty’s ’scutem on the lamp-bracket.</p>

<p>The home team stared curiously at Wiggie as he
came in, carrying a few mufflers and a camp-stool
belonging to Helwise, for half of them had heard him
sing, the day before, and the half that hadn’t wished it
had, while both halves had just been told by Harriet
that of course he wouldn’t be the slightest use in the
game, so that they must all back him as much as they
could. Certainly, he did not give an impression of
superfluous strength; indeed, when he had taken off
his coat, he looked as fragile and hopeless an athlete
as you could possibly expect to see, so much so that
the brawny captain-back of the opposing side came up
and implored Harriet to “put it somewhere where I
can’t hit it!”</p>

<p>Wiggie didn’t hear him, but he wouldn’t have cared
if he had. The soft, bright air was wine in his blood.
The press of the spring turf lent him a buoyancy not
his own. The strength of union, of interdependence
and support, put fire into his slack muscles. He stole
the ball from the red shirts when it shot out suddenly
from the circle, and was trying to persuade the Bulger
that he had always belonged to it, when Harriet stalked
up. She looked very trim and hard and clean and
extremely well put together. You could picture her
lasting through half-a-dozen matches without losing
so much as a hairpin.</p>

<p>“Where do you want to play?” she demanded.
“You’d better go and stand about somewhere at the
back, hadn’t you? I’m putting all the strength into
the attack—it’s the only thing to do with this team.
Johnson” (the brawny captain) “loses his head if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
you keep on nagging at him. Suppose you take the
right, and mark that little black-headed curate on their
left outer? You’ll be worth your salt if you only
keep <i>him</i> occupied. He’s a terror! Cut him over the
shins if he won’t behave. There’s plenty of weft in
that stick of yours.”</p>

<p>Wiggie twiddled the Bulger discontentedly, showing
the “L. Lancaster” cut clearly on the blade. A
tinge of colour came into Harriet’s face.</p>

<p>“It’s too heavy!” he murmured mournfully. “You
see, when you get going up the field, it’s always just
a second behind your wrist——” He tried to execute
a double twist that didn’t come off. Harriet looked
scornful.</p>

<p>“You don’t need to ‘get going’ when you’re back.
All you’ve got to do is to let out, but I suppose you
won’t be able to clear far. And if the thing tires you”—she
looked down casually at her own lighter, handier
weapon—“I don’t mind changing. An ounce or so
makes no odds to <i>me</i>!”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I shouldn’t dream—I didn’t mean——!”
Wiggie protested, and then stopped. “If you’re sure
you don’t mind, I dare say I should get on ever so
much better.”</p>

<p>Harriet did not mind. You could see how little
she minded, running her firm fingers along the rubber
where Lancaster’s hands had so often gripped. Wiggie
tried the double twist with ecstatic success.</p>

<p>“This’ll do me all right.” Harriet tucked the stick
under her arm with a kind of savage shame. “By
the way, of course you know Lanty let me in, too?
I’ve the rottenest lot of friends anywhere—barring
you, of course! <i>You’ve</i> been a sport. Very well,
then, you get along back and do what you can if
anything comes your way. Johnson won’t have to
worry about you, then. He seems nervous of breaking
you. Don’t get crocked up or anything—it wastes
time so rottenly; and let Saunders have as much of
the game as he wants, otherwise he’ll sulk. For
goodness’ sake remember that the goal-posts are none<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
too steady, so don’t get shoving against them. And
keep an eye on the curate!”</p>

<p>Wiggie walked sadly to the back. He had never
played back, and he had no wish to begin now. How
was he to get his glorious five minutes if he stood
about and did nothing? He would just dodder and
shiver and wither away into thin air, and there was
nothing dramatic about <i>that</i>. And the point-twist
simply wouldn’t get a show. Delicate art of that kind
wasn’t needed at back. You hit out slashingly, and
then stood with your feet crossed and bowed to the
crowd, until the idiot in front whom you had fed so
prettily allowed another idiot to grab the ball and
send it back again. He wouldn’t clear far, having
parted with Lanty’s sledge. Harriet’s possession was
nearly sure to sting if he began putting anything
into it, and in any case Saunders was to have the
limelight.</p>

<p>Saunders, fair-haired and finely built, greeted him
without enthusiasm. He had just been telling the
goalkeeper that he would have all the work to do,
just as if that wasn’t exactly what he wanted. Five
minutes before he had told her that, owing to the
rotten scheme of attack, he never hoped to see a ball
all afternoon, but he expected her to have forgotten
that. The goalkeeper said it was a shame to both
remarks, and prayed that, if a ball ever did arrive, he
wouldn’t knock her down inside the goal-posts and sit
on her, as he had a trick of doing. She was a bright-faced
young person in pads, and nodded genially to
Wiggie as he came up shyly. She wanted to tell
him that she had heard him sing, and though of
course she liked this sort of thing much better, she
could do with a tune now and then. Wiggie thanked
her sweetly for doing with it, and told her how much
he admired her in her perilous position. At least
Harriet had not put him <i>there</i>, to combine the philosophy
of a fisherman with the stoicism of an Aunt
Sally.</p>

<p>Saunders suddenly felt rather jealous, and came and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
joined them. He was pleased to be patronising and
instructive, if somewhat contra-law-and-order.</p>

<p>“The great thing is to keep in your <i>place</i>!” he
said kindly. “Never mind if you think the ball is
six yards nearer your side than mine; it probably
isn’t. You leave it to me. <i>I’ll</i> see to it all right.
But if you come barging in just as I get there, we
shan’t hit anything but each other, and the ball will
be pushed through; whereas, if you keep out of the
way, I can give our forwards a chance. You spend
your time looking after the left outer. He’s always
offside—know what that is, of course?—and fouls
every other minute, but it’s no earthly use appealing.
Knewstubb is much too busy looking after his legs to
remember he’s a whistle in his mouth, and in any
case no referee pays any attention to appeals about
Davids—they’re too fed up on ’em. So don’t waste
your breath yelling over his operations, but sneak the
ball from him any way you can get at it, and if he
starts shoving, just shove him back!”</p>

<p>Wiggie cheered a little. The glorious five minutes
were evidently not to be his, but something offered. To
go down to death in a locked struggle with the curate
was not exactly an heroic finish, but it was better than
shivering into nothingness. He went to his post with
more hope.</p>

<p>The teams lined up under the faint but kindly sun,
between the clean, white lines and the clean flags at
the corners. There was a graceful, curly-headed youth
bullying-off for Bluecaster, with Harriet at centre-half
a good deal closer behind the ball than was safe for
her excellent front teeth. On her left she had a strong
Army Major, backing a wild and ineffectual left outer
with masses of hair on the point of descent, and a
clever left inner, the kindest and most unselfish player
in the team. At her other hand was a long-legged
person of the male persuasion, excitably pretending
to support the best right outer in the county, a young
girl with a tightly tied mane and the cheerful trot of
a Shetland pony. As her inner she had a meek little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
man who lived only to get rid of the ball to somebody
else, after the manner of cowards who funk the sixpence
in “Up Jenkins!” Stubbs was in the middle of the
field, with a nervous eye revolving round him. Raymond,
the opposing centre-forward, had a trick of
lifting the ball about the level of your knee-cap. If
it came his way, he should skip. He blew the whistle,
and skipped.</p>

<p>Harriet’s offensive policy answered very well at first.
The home team knew the tiny drop in the gradient that
carried a sudden rush irresistibly into the net, and
made the most of it. For some time a furious warfare
raged round the visitors’ circle, and then the Shetland
pony got a pretty shot home, passed her politely by
the unambitious inner. After that, though Bluecaster
still kept in the foreign half, they were held away from
the ring, and Wiggie watched the curate edging slowly
up, waiting for the hungry backs to rush into the fray,
leaving him offside and well ahead for his centre-half’s
clearing drive. He was a black-headed, blue-eyed,
boyish little thing, as strong as a horse, with an impudent,
twinkling smile and no sporting conscience
whatever. Wiggie, drooping wearily on the exact
square foot of earth appointed him by Saunders, tried
to intimidate him with a glance, and failed.</p>

<p>The drive came, a long, low, steady shot with half
the field before it, aimed clean and true at the red shirt
on the line, and Wiggie’s white shirt stepped out to
meet it. But even as he stopped it neatly with his
stick, earning a cheer from the spectators, a plunging,
leaping Saunders fell upon him out of the far distance
and squashed him to the earth, hacking wildly as he
tumbled after him; and while they were busy disentangling
themselves, the ball was passed to the waiting
curate, who banged it in at the net, regardless of the
shrieked appeals of the deserted goalkeeper. Stubbs
had met Saunders in his kangaroo career and was
badly injured in the ribs, which rendered him incapable
of listening to claims of any kind. He gave the goal
with a mule-like obstinacy. He knew Harriet would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
make it hot for him afterwards, but he didn’t care.
He would give that galloping Saunders something to
remember him by—dashed if he wouldn’t!</p>

<p>And all the way back to their posts, Saunders pointed
out to his colleague that that was what came of not
playing the game, and hoped he’d profit by it.</p>

<p>“You see, my dear fellow,” he said earnestly,
“everything went wrong just because you didn’t
follow our arrangement. If you’d stayed and minded
the curate, as I think you <i>said</i> you would, I should
have got the ball away nicely, and you wouldn’t have
been there to hamper me when I arrived. Yes, I
know it <i>looked</i> as if it was coming straight to you,
and as if it was in your half of the ground and not
mine, but it doesn’t do to be led away by these things.
I admit I was a second late, because I ran over that
idiot Knewstubb, who was watching you instead of
attending to me. And, by the way, it really isn’t
safe on a ground like this to stop a long shot with your
stick. All very well on South-Country cricket-pitches,
but no use on rough stuff like ours up here. Very
pretty and swanky, of course, if it comes off, and goes
down A 1 with the crowd, but it’s too big a risk to
be really sporting. Use your feet, man—use your
feet!—and do give me a free hand. A really first-class
player has no chance, my dear fellow, if he isn’t
allowed to have his head.”</p>

<p>Wiggie didn’t answer because Saunders had flattened
all the breath out of him, and the next minute Harriet
came up and pitched into both of them. He felt a
hearty, uprising hatred of several people, but especially
of the curate, twinkling cheerfully where he now stood
decorously with his front line.</p>

<p>The little imp grew shameless after that, and Wiggie
had his hands full with him. He had all the engaging
tricks of the trade—turning on the ball, putting his
foot on it, pushing with his shoulder or his little
black head, and using more or less any part of his
stick that came first; perpetrating each offence with
the same maddening, childlike gaiety and delight.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
The gentle Wiggie could gladly have strangled him.
They fought away in a far corner—Stubbs turning a
blind eye, and Saunders behind, shouting a lordly—“Here,
sir, here!”—the little, scratching, jabbing,
twisting, poking game that kills quicker than the
wildest spurt, until the singer was sick and stupid,
with a swimming brain and a clamour in his ears.
Bits of the “Elijah” joined forces with Saunders and
added their quota to the muddle in his poor head.
“What have I to do with thee, O man of God?”
“Here, sir, here!” “They have laid a net for my
feet.” (The curate had his wicked little stick hooked
firmly round Wiggie’s leg.) “Yet doth the Lord see
it not.” “Behind you, sir! Back to your left....
<span class="smcap">Left</span>, I said, you ass!” “Mark how the scorner
derideth.... It is enough.... See mine affliction!”
“Shoot! Shoot!” “There is no breath left in
me.”</p>

<p>By the end of the first half he was trembling, gasping
and half-blind, and he had had no five minutes.
Harriet came up and looked at him anxiously.</p>

<p>“Bit done, aren’t you?” she said. He was working
for her at the present moment, so must be cared for,
just as he had had to have glasses of new milk during
the election. “Afraid you’ve had a thin time with
Davids. I can’t think why the clubs don’t combine
and refuse to play against him. He’s quite a decent
little chap, though, off the field. Doesn’t take the
thing seriously enough—that’s what’s wrong. I
thought that stick of mine wouldn’t be any good to
you—you want something beefy for Davids. Perhaps
you’d like to have Lanty’s back again? Saunders
brought you down a nasty whack; must have hurt
you somewhere. He’s a clumsy ass. Only last week,
he got his stick fast in a girl’s hair, and pulled some of
it out by the roots. Look here, hadn’t you better
knock off altogether? We’ll get along somehow.
Saunders hasn’t begun to stretch himself yet, and I
can do a bit more, too. I’m resigned to lose, anyhow.
Stubbs will just simply give the whole blooming game<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
away if Saunders hits him again. I wish Lanty had
been here! There’ll be no saving us in any case if
Teddy Dunn” (the centre-forward) “loses his wool
after half-time, as he always does. His nerves aren’t
guaranteed to wear the whole seventy minutes. Well,
ease up for a while, won’t you? Hang about on the
touch-line if you don’t care to go up to the house,
and if you feel like chipping in again later, well, chip!”</p>

<p>She brought him his coat, and snatched the camp-stool
from a bleating Helwise, and a kind little kid-gloved
lady, who had been calling somewhere, produced
some smelling-salts from a russia-leather bag. He
sat on the camp-stool with his head in his hands,
bitterly ashamed but helpless, and wishing with all
his heart that Saunders had finished him off completely.
He had not meant any of it to be in the least like this.
He had hugged a vision of fleeting, soaring ecstasy,
and—with God be the rest!—but it seemed that
things didn’t happen like that. This was shrieking
farce and despicable exhibition—no saving grace about
it anywhere. But he would not go up to the house,
though his face burned every time anybody looked at
him. He was an object of utter derision, and, worse—pity,
but he would not go up to the house, though
his whole soul turned to it with longing. He must
stop until the last chance of glory was past; so he
clung to his stick, refusing to give it up, and sniffed
bravely at the smelling-salts, hoping and praying that
he might feel able to “chip in again, later.”</p>

<p>The second half opened with instant trouble for
Bluecaster, for the visiting team, having now the
better of the gradient, ran through like greased lightning
before Saunders had finished impressing upon
his goalkeeper that he was perfectly equal to doing
both Wigmore’s work and his own without her stepping
out of the net. Harriet said nothing—just looked at
him—and he was a good deal more careful after that.
Wiggie found himself admiring her as he sat on his
camp-stool, noticing her steady control of the team,
absence of fuss, and the neat strength of her play.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
She spoke out when necessary, but she did not nag,
and she took reversal with stoic calm. She had not
even opened her lips to Stubbs when he had failed
her so disgracefully. There was something rather fine
about her, even if she did push you; and again he felt
the queer sense of comfort in being pushed.</p>

<p>The curate came and condoled with him, standing
the while in his usual illegal and colossally impertinent
position, and Wiggie found him quite a decent sort,
after all, if somewhat weak in customary sporting
ethics. Nevertheless, he had a philosophy of his own
which he expounded with charming insouciance.</p>

<p>“What’s the fun of sticking to rules?” he asked
brightly. “Any old donkey can stick to rules, but it
takes brain to be always just on the wrong side of the
law without getting collared. Besides, it’s frightfully
interesting seeing how the other man gets his hair up
when you foul him all round the place. <i>You</i> took it
first-class, like a regular turn-the-other-cheek Sunday-school
teacher. You were jolly nippy, too—took me
all my time to keep ahead of you! Awfully sorry if
I worried you too much; you do look rottenly off
colour. Wish you’d buck up, though, and come on
again. I can’t get any fun out of Hoofy Saunders—he
doesn’t enter into the spirit of the thing like you.
Hoofy just gets his hair blazing and lams into you
and yells for help, and there’s no seeing past his feet
when once the ball’s on the other side.”</p>

<p>Play kept pretty well to the middle of the ground
for some time after this, the Witham attack being
warded off by Harriet and a somewhat humbled
Saunders. Then the Most Kind and Unselfish Member
of the Team put in a kind and unselfish goal, so gently
that the goalkeeper did not even see it; but there the
luck ended. Fresh disaster fell upon Bluecaster.
Teddy Dunn “lost his wool.”</p>

<p>Teddy was a pretty player, supple and light, very
quick on the ball, and very easy with his stick, but
the excitement of the game invariably set his usually
pleasant temper bubbling hot. In common with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
whole team, he had been thoroughly ruffled by Stubbs’
cruel behaviour in presenting Witham with a patently
unearned goal, and when, fifteen minutes before time,
the opposing centre-half caught him napping over a
simple shot at the nets, incidentally waking him with
a drive across the shins, he shook off Harriet’s yoke
and let himself go altogether.</p>

<p>Ceasing to take any notice of the game, he concentrated
his attention upon following up the centre-half
in order to pay him back in his own coin, and various
unauthorised persons dug the ball from under their
feet as the murderous debt was cleared. General
disorganisation ensued, ending in a passionate onslaught
on the Bluecaster goal, setting Wiggie quivering to
help. When he could bear it no longer, he dragged
off his coat and took himself back to his place. Nobody
noticed him in the hurly-burly, until the ball clove a
miraculous path out of the crowded circle, leaving a
fiery sting running clean up to his shoulder, and the
first thrill of exultation that the game had brought
him yet. But as the centre-forward was still adding
interest to payment, the ball soon came back again,
and the frantic scramble resumed. Wiggie slammed
and rammed, saved and better saved, listening as in
a dream to Saunders’ mechanical “With you, sir!
Here, sir, here!” and to Stubbs’ announcement—somewhere
on the lip of Hell—that there wanted only
five minutes to time. He had a vision of the curate
standing practically inside the nets, imperturbably
ignoring the goalkeeper’s expostulations, and then, as
if dropped from Heaven, his own chance rushed upon
him. The ball was suddenly in the crook of his stick,
cuddling there as though it loved it. He caught a
glimpse of a Shetland mane away on the rim of the
circle, and slipped through to it between a horde of
clashing weapons. Saunders, drunk with agitation,
tried to drive the ball back again, catching him on the
foot with his heavy swing, but he hopped free, and was
out in open country. Then was seen the shocking
spectacle of a centre-forward far behind, doggedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
leaning on his stick, while a staid full back carried the
game home. The Shetland pony swung into line with
a jolly little chuckle, and a second later the M.K. and
U.P. came up on Wiggie’s left. The three passed up
the field as the wind-shadows pass above clover.
Harriet was not far after them; he could hear her call
to the other halves to follow up, and was conscious of
complete independence of all the halves in the United
Kingdom. <i>Now</i> he felt the lift of the elastic earth,
the free, flying joy that he had craved all afternoon.
<i>Now</i> his choice of stick was justified, the ball running
steadily before the sharp, little strokes. Wiggie might
be fragile, but he was the right shape. His sally had
the grace of a flying Mercury, and the Shetland pony,
keeping easily level, chuckled a second time. She
nodded across to the M.K. and U.P., and he sent back
his own M.K. smile of content. This was the real
stuff, the smile and the nod said alike. What on
earth had this treasure been doing at the back?</p>

<p>He knew that he had no business where he was, the
newly-imported rotter who ought to have been minding
his nets, the miserable failure who so lately had sat
on a camp-stool and sniffed at smelling-salts. He
felt certain that Saunders sulked behind in utter
scandalisation, but he did not care. Still inside the
Bluecaster goal, the curate gaped in open-mouthed
astonishment, but he had forgotten the curate. He
had his five minutes. The gods had heard his prayer,
and not allowed him to pass away shamed.</p>

<p>“He that shall endure to the end.... Arise, Elijah,
for thou hast a long journey before thee.... Forty
days and forty nights shalt thou go.” Not every part
of him seemed to be working at once, but some of him
would get there. His feet were still moving, and his
wrist, but his eyes—“Night falleth round me, O
Lord!” Saunders would say he hadn’t kept his
place—Hoofy Saunders—but Harriet would be pleased,
anyhow, and that was the chief thing. Here were
the backs, Johnson and Co.—“Go, return upon thy
way! Then did Elijah the prophet break forth like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
a fire”—<i>that</i> got him all right, and it was quite
simple! If he fell down suddenly, would his feet
still go on running, running? They seemed to know
all about it, more than he did, but he would get away
from here soon and lie down in Harriet’s parlour.
“Though thousands languish and fall beside thee”—nasty
E♯ that for the tenors in the fifty-seventh bar!
There was a rocking-chair, too, and a kitten, and somebody
with a black face. “Through darkness riseth
light, light for the upright”—awful jar for Saunders, his
getting away like this! Ah, but what came after?
“Shall the dead arise, the dead arise and praise thee?
Lord, our Creator, how excellent thy name is! My
flesh also shall rest in hope.”</p>

<p>The Witham left back came out steadily and with
discretion, and Wiggie’s twist carried the ball round
him as easily as a dancer spins a pirouette, leaving
him staring. The right sprang to meet the attack,
and he passed out to the Pony, who passed back just
as the racing left crossed them a second time. The
Witham halves were coming up, thudding and panting,
but the three were not to be caught. The right back
sprang again, shouting to his partner, and Wiggie
passed to the Most Kind, who dribbled cleverly to
the line as if meaning to shoot, and then, with a
lightning turn, centred back to the stranger. Wiggie
took the ball daintily on his stick, Saunders or no
Saunders, meeting the final rush of the recovered left
with the same bewildering trick, and, as the goalkeeper
danced and slashed, aimed delicately past
her into the net. The whistle blew.</p>

<p>But as the teams came up, both sides ready with
praise (always excepting Saunders, limping vaingloriously),
Wiggie walked straight off the ground
without looking at anybody, not discourteously, but
as if very pressing business were hurrying him away.
Indeed, from the moment he took the ball in the Bluecaster
circle until he had scored his goal, crossed the
field and disappeared, he never really stopped at all.
It didn’t do to stop. He must go on walking ...<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
walking ... “Lord, our Creator” ... not rushing,
but just walking, or he would never get to the other
end. The curate tore after him, waving a coat, but
he did not look back. If he turned his head, he would
never reach the farm, because he couldn’t see it any
longer. He could only go on walking towards the
place where it had been a minute ago. There was a
stile somewhere in the field; his feet would find it all
right. He had really wonderful feet; it was only all
the rest of him that was wrong—his heart and his
lungs and his head and his blind eyes. Well, it was
something to have feet, anyhow. Gravel path, surely?
Feet again! And then steps and a flagged floor.
It was time he got there, because even his feet would
have to stop soon. Yes, he was there ... he could
feel the fire, though he could not see it ... there
would be the kitten and the rocker.... “Lord, our
Creator ... Lord, our——”</p>

<p>Harriet explained that Mr. Wigmore was knocked
up, probably wanted to rest. No, she had not known
he was <i>that</i> sort of player. He had given her to
understand he knew nothing about the game. Anyhow,
he had won the match for them, snatched it out
of the fire at the last moment; not but what they had
won it by rights already! If they would kindly make
their way to the house, they would find tea in the
usual place.</p>

<p>She shepherded them up to the back of the farm,
and through the kitchen into the house-place, where
tea was set on the long table, but in her heart she was
troubled. Wiggie had not joined them. Perhaps he
was not in the house at all. Perhaps he had gone for
quiet to the parlour. She had her hand on the door
when a long, gray car drew up at the gate, and the
men she had seen at the church hurried up the path.
The tale of the gardener’s boy at Watters had not
satisfied them, and after a dismal lunch at the “Four
Feathers” they had started out on a fresh hunt.
Rumours had met them at last of a match and a
stranger playing for Bluecaster—“a lile chap what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
sings a bit”—and in spite of incredulity had come on
the wanderer’s trail to Wild Duck. The hatchet-faced
man pushed past Harriet into the house.</p>

<p>“Is he here?” he flashed. He looked ready to
drop.</p>

<p>Harriet put her hand back to the parlour door and
hesitated. She understood him at once, and for some
reason she felt frightened, frightened as she had never
been in her life.</p>

<p>“I—don’t know!” she stammered, holding the
knob tight; then made an effort to pull herself together.
“If you mean Mr. Wigmore, I am just
looking for him. He may be resting in here, away
from the crowd. He seemed very tired after the
match.”</p>

<p>The hatchet-faced man echoed “<i>Match!</i>” in a tone
that was half-bitter irony and half a snarling curse.
The big man behind laughed a sad and perfectly
hopeless laugh. One of them took the knob out of
Harriet’s hand and pushed the door. On the hearth
by the steel fender Wiggie was fallen, the comforting
glow of the fire playing over his white shirt and his
closed eyes. The rocker stood empty above his quiet
head. The kitten curled, purring, in the curve of his
helpless arm.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>But he was not dead. Sitting alone in her own
room, Harriet willed it with all the force of her personality.
He <i>should</i> not be dead! The men had
said he was, and he had looked it, lying there without
a breath, but she would not have it so. After they
had carried him up to Stubbs’ room and shut the door
on her, she had gone across to her own and willed him
violently back to existence. He had been her player,
her loyal man; he was her guest. He could not die
under her roof. In some inexplicable fashion he
seemed to belong to her, this stranger from another
life and another world.</p>

<p>Downstairs, the teams made merry, wondering a
little what had happened to their hostess. Somebody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
had seen a car come up; perhaps she was wanted on
business. That Wigmore chap had disappeared, too.
Pity! They would have liked a word with him.
Somebody said he was stopping at Watters, so probably
he had cleared off at once. He had certainly looked
thoroughly played out. Stubbs, explaining to a bursting
Saunders exactly how and where he would not be
hit by him again, was unaware of any tragedy passing
overhead. Only the little curate, emerging last from
a flying bath, with his round face glowing above the
neatest of clericals, paused on the landing upstairs,
brought to halt by a sure instinct of trouble. As he
did so, the door sprang open in his face, and a desperate
man strode out on top of him. He recoiled when he
saw the parsonic figure, as if it had struck him.</p>

<p>“What’s brought <i>you</i> along?” he demanded roughly.
“He’s not dead, yet—not going to be dead, I tell
you! You can take yourself and your psalm-singing
off again!”</p>

<p>Davids said: “Hockey—bath—just passing—can
I help?” with cogent simplicity, and the other relaxed.
He thrust a paper into the curate’s hand.</p>

<p>“Fetch the nearest doctor, will you, and ask him
to bring anything he can? Car at the door. There’s
a chemist somewhere in this county, I suppose? If
not, send the chauffeur to Lancaster—Manchester—anywhere.
Fire along, and never mind limits. We
pay. But for God’s sake hurry!”</p>

<p>He shut the door as abruptly as he had opened it,
and the little curate slid downstairs as if dropped from
the banisters. They called him in to tea as he passed,
but he did not stop to reply. Hungry but valiant,
he tore down the path, sending before him the name
of the profession that sets every wheel racing and
every hoof at the beat. The chauffeur had his engine
started before the passenger was in the car, and leaped
back to his seat. They became a very sudden blur
in the distance. Whatever his philosophy, the curate
certainly had the knack of being always on the spot.</p>

<p>Tea finished in the house-place, and Johnson, shouting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
down a perfect roar of argument and contradiction,
was busy illustrating with Harriet’s china just how
Wigmore had got his goal, when a cool medical voice
broke across the hubbub.</p>

<p>“Will somebody kindly tell me who owns this
house?”</p>

<p>Stubbs took his head out of a teacup, and came
forward and said that he did, which was not in the
least true, but sounded well.</p>

<p>“Then perhaps you will forgive me for asking that
it may be kept as quiet as possible? Mr. Wigmore is
upstairs, dangerously ill. I doubt if he will live through
the night.”</p>

<p>He disappeared before anybody’s breath had come
back, and the stricken teams hunted hats and coats
in a graveyard silence, stealing forth as if from a
meeting in the Catacombs. Queer that Stubbs
shouldn’t have known!—but then Stubbs never did
know anything for two minutes together. Made a
chap feel such a bounder, yelling and roaring with a
sick man overhead! Certainly, Harriet had vanished
clean off the earth; they might have guessed something
was up, from that. It had been a queer match altogether;
one they wouldn’t be likely to forget in a month
of Sundays. The push-bikes crept down into the road,
and silently faded away, and a death-like, terrible
peace descended upon the farm.</p>

<p>The car came back, bringing a local doctor and a
nurse, who disappeared upstairs without asking for
anybody. The curate had been explicit. He himself
stayed outside with the chauffeur, munching a penny
bun. Harriet came down into the parlour, and was
joined by Stubbs, whose voluble demands for explanation
she strangled savagely into silence. Nobody
took any notice of either of them. They might not
have existed.</p>

<p>The shadows were well down in the little room when
the hatchet-faced man was heard in the garden,
directing the chauffeur to take the curate to the
station, and then the door opened, and the strangers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
came in. Harriet asked “How is he?” and Stubbs
looked around and behind him, not recognising the
voice.</p>

<p>The hatchet-faced man opened the fingers of an
expressive hand, and shut them again.</p>

<p>“A long way on!” he answered, and wondered at
himself. He had never heard the expression until a
minute before, when the nurse had used it on the
stairs. “But we shall bring him back,” he added—“perhaps.
We won’t waste time discussing that. I
have to apologise for taking possession of your house
in this extraordinary manner. We cannot thank you
enough for allowing us to do so. I should be glad to
explain.”</p>

<p>Harriet said “Sit down, won’t you?” in the same
voice that had set Stubbs peering into corners. She
found a match and lighted the centre lamp. The big
man said nothing.</p>

<p>“My name is Gardner. I am a Londoner—Wigmore’s
medical adviser, and incidentally his oldest
friend. Before he left town, last month, I told him—though
he didn’t need telling—that his voice was
killing him. I warned him that any out-of-the-way
effort would probably finish him; that in any case he
would not last another year unless he took instant
precautions. He had just had a big concert in London,
and I knew—what I knew. He promised me to throw
up all his engagements and come down here for absolute
rest, and I let him go because I believed he would
keep his word. On Monday night I discovered by
the merest chance that he was to sing here on Tuesday,
and I left London before six in the morning—<i>we</i> left
London—but we were too late to stop him. He
would neither have listened to us then, nor forgiven
us ever after. God! but I thought he would die
before the thing was through! <i>That</i> was mad and
bad enough, but on top of it he goes and plays in a
hockey-match, after leading us a dance round half
the county to prevent us finding out. What’s at the
back of it all I can’t possibly imagine! Perhaps <i>you</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
can. Who is the insensate fool that led him to fling
away his last little gasp of life?”</p>

<p>Stubbs stirred uneasily. He thought Dr. Gardner
should be told that such language was unfitting the
company of both a past and present Rur’l D’trict
C’cillor. The big man by the window still said nothing,
and nobody introduced him. His eyes travelled from
one face to another with pathetic, questioning intensity.</p>

<p>And, at last, “<i>I</i> am the insensate fool!” said
Harriet, in the voice of Eve after the Fall. “<i>I</i> bullied
him to sing. <i>I</i> pestered him to play. I told him that
all he wanted was fresh air and hopping about. He
tried to say no, but I said yes, and he always did what
I told him. I made him.”</p>

<p>The doctor drew in his breath as if physically hurt.
He struck his hands together with a little movement
of passionate regret.</p>

<p>“Then you will probably have the satisfaction of
knowing that you have killed the finest singer in
England.”</p>

<p>She winced sharply, but surprise came uppermost.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand! We knew he was a singer,
of course, but not of any importance. His name is
never in the papers.”</p>

<p>“He sings under his mother’s name—the famous
Quetta. You’ve heard of <i>her</i>, I suppose, even at this
Back o’ Beyond? You must have heard of him, too.
<i>He’s</i> the great Quetta, now—makes pots of money,
and is wanted everywhere. His agent in town was
tearing his hair to come along with us. He can close
his account now. Quetta’s done! I suppose you
<i>might</i> not know, though. He liked to be incog. here,
and his friends respected his wish for quiet. Well,
<i>you’ve</i> quietened him all right! He should have
stopped singing, years ago, but he had a reason for
going on, a good reason——” He caught the big man’s
eyes fixed earnestly on his lips, and checked himself with
a vexed start. The other stood up slowly and looked
at Harriet. (It was strange how both seemed to forget
Stubbs.) His voice was low, with a curious intonation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>“I am that reason,” he said quietly. “I am Cyril’s
half-brother, and once—it seems a very long time ago
now—I was a singer, too. I had my own share of
our mother’s gift, and I was getting on well. I
might have been a great Quetta, also. Then I had an
accident which left me totally deaf. I had no other
trade in my hands, and I had both wife and children.
Cyril was just coming out, and he took every engagement
that came his way to bring us in a living. It
was in those first hard years of fight that he broke
his health. He kept us all then, and he keeps us all
now. I do not know why he never told. Perhaps he
was afraid that Mr. Shaw—his friend—would give
him money. I do what I can for him—I learned the
lip language, and I am now his secretary—but I do
not earn half we cost him. And I have never heard
him sing. I would give everything I have or ever
hope to have, just to hear Cyril sing.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Stubbs was sent down to the White Lion to telephone
to Watters, and a middle-aged damsel at the other end
clasped a treacle-posset to her bosom and wept. Long
into the dawn Harriet sat by a burnt-out lamp in the
little parlour. The walking-mail went by in the
smallest hours, the creak of the wheels alone coming
up to her, like a ghostly, undriven hearse of the dead.
And when the first cock crew, just as if it were Harriet’s
imperative voice calling him, the great Cyril Quetta,
who was, after all, only Wiggie, struggled back to life,
and observed that he was a sparking-plug.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br>

<small>THE TROUBLE COMING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> twenty-ninth of March. Lancaster had been
at the Pride. Now he was walking along the north
road, where he had stood with Francey Dockeray,
months ago. They had had a good winter, just enough
hard weather and little wind, and the spring was
wonderfully early. The whole countryside breathed
an atmosphere more like that of late Easter than
wild March. But March had had no lion in it, this
year. It had come in like a lamb, and continued
to frolic softly onwards, crowned with garlands, like
a sacrifice frisking to the altar.</p>

<p>He walked slowly, loving the kind air and the
delicate light lying over the land, and his soul was
at peace. His visit to the Pride had left him happier
than he had expected. For long, the necessity of
it had haunted him, and he had shrunk, without
admitting it, from what he possibly might find. But
there had been nothing to disturb or alarm. Wolf
looked very old, but in better spirits than when he
had last seen him, for old age has its own medicine
of the mind. He spent most of his time at the last
Ninekyrkes fence, looking over the fields. The new
tenants were not into the house yet, but they were
at work on the land, and he found a queer, half-bitter
interest in watching others till his soil. Mrs. Whinnerah
was a great deal thinner, seemed to have no
more substance than a blown straw, but she was
much softer in manner than Lanty had ever known
her. Her eyes, grown large as she grew small, had
the exalted, aloof, almost happy expression of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
martyr-fanatic, but they rested more kindly upon
him than of yore.</p>

<p>The little Pride was a model of neatness and comfort.
He found himself envying them its cosy quiet, until,
looking up, he saw the Lugg towering in at the window.
For a moment he had the impression that his own
satisfaction, the woman’s calm and the man’s quiet
were all alike due to one terrible fascination, the
charm that holds a fated creature still before a beast
that springs. It was gone directly, and, as he walked
with Wolf on the new land, they talked again of his
father’s planning. He saw it broken up, portioned
out, houses built, fences set, a new estate growing
under the shelter of the Lugg. When there was a
little colony there, the loneliness would vanish, and
those that had never known it would laugh at the old
tale of a dead fear.</p>

<p>Bluecaster was still at home, waiting. He seemed
bored and rather restless, but he would not leave.
When Lancaster suggested a Swiss trip, or at
least some sort of a party in the big house, he
could generally produce some halting excuse; but
one day, when hard pressed, he said simply: “It’s
March!” and looked at the barometer. Lanty
wanted to laugh, but forbore. There were days
when it did not do to laugh at Bluecaster. He could
make you feel that you were laughing, not only at
him, but at nine other Baron Bluecasters behind him.</p>

<p>Well, March was passing, wearing a dainty face
showing neither fear nor frown. This was Friday,
and Sunday would be Mid-Lent Sunday. The worst
of the year was over, thank goodness, and with luck
there should be a second good season in front. He
was almost sure there would be another good season.</p>

<p>He asked after Lup. He would sail to-morrow,
it seemed. They had had a letter, saying a last
good-bye after the most circumscribed method of
good-byes. Lanty had the letter to read, and wondered
how long it had taken him to frame the clipped sentences.
At the bottom of the page, far below the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
abrupt signature, three words were scribbled, as if
jerked into being by some ghost-hand gripping his
elbow. Almost indecipherable, they evolved themselves
on inspection into “Wait of me,” and no
more. Completely out of touch with the letter both
in spirit and position, they gave the impression that
the writer might have sealed the cover without ever
knowing they were there.</p>

<p>Mrs. Whinnerah saw the agent’s eyes on the message,
and smiled faintly.</p>

<p>“There’s that as waits for nobody,” she said
enigmatically, and turned her face to the window.
And again the thought came to him, as it had come,
months before, that she saw what no other eye could
envisage.</p>

<p>The old couple walked with him to the fence, and
there he bade them farewell.</p>

<p>“I’ll be back again before long,” he said cheerily,
shaking each by the hand. “I’ll be looking you up
again soon”—and knew not what truth he spoke.
So they parted, with mutual kindly smile and thought
and word; and as they turned from each other at
last, a magpie fluttered out of the fence and stood
between them, lonely and alone on the alone and
lonely road.</p>

<p>Young Rowly came out from Ladyford at his hail,
and his sister behind him. Mother and father were
away for the day, it seemed. Francey met him with
her usual pleasant manner. Lup’s departure had left
her apparently untouched, he thought. Perhaps, after
all, it had been best for him to go.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Bracken Holliday, lately?” she
asked, as he put a foot into the boat, a subtle change
coming over her tone.</p>

<p>Some undercurrent of sympathy made Lanty
start, realising that the man had been in his mind,
also.</p>

<p>“Why, no!” he answered, steadying himself in the
boat, and looking at her instead of crossing to the
stern. “What’s his Loftiness been doing with himself?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
Getting engaged, or making ready to stand for the
County? I hear he was a great man at election-time.”</p>

<p>Young Rowly looked up from his seat with a ripple
of mirth running over his clear, young face.</p>

<p>“Nothing o’ <i>that</i> sort! He’s got religion. He’s
taken to going to church!”</p>

<p>“Not just Sundays, to show off the fit of his coat,”
Francey explained. “He’s done that, all along. Rowly
means Lent services—weekday services. Brack’s
there, every time!”</p>

<p>“But what’s taken him? Some girl gone back
on him? Or has he lost another pig or something?”</p>

<p>She looked down at the sand. There were words
on her lips, plainly enough, but she did not utter
them. Rowly, however, supplied the deficiency with
the same happy haste.</p>

<p>“If you want to know, sir, he’s praying for <i>you</i>!”</p>

<p>“For me? What in creation——! For <i>me</i>?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir—for you. He says there’s something
awful coming along, and you’re responsible for it.
Says if he can only get the Almighty to listen to
reason, He’ll happen let you off and give you another
chance. So he goes to church every day, motor-machine,
bettremer clothes an’ all!”</p>

<p>Lanty scrambled over, and sat down with a bump
and a laugh. It was difficult to take any theory
seriously that included a vision of Brack, pale-gray
suit, Trilby and S.-F., waving wild arms in supplication
before the Lord.</p>

<p>“Seems to me Brack must have collected a germ
or two on the other side of the pond! He’s a queer
specimen. Well, I’m grateful for anybody’s prayers.
Who knows? Brack’s may do me a good turn yet!”</p>

<p>Over the sand, he went to Pippin Hall for his horse.
Uncle Willie was in the yard, and walked with him
for some distance along the dyked road. He remembered
afterwards how many people seemed to have
stopped and held him, as if loth to let him go, on that
last journey round the banks.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ll be over at this feed to-morrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
night, you and your lads?” he inquired—“Mr.
Shaw’s hotpot supper at the ‘Duke.’”</p>

<p>“Ay, we’ll happen show up. T’ element’s quiet
enough at present.” He cast a keen look over the
sky, and then the deep-set eyes twinkled, dropping
to Lanty’s face. “They seem a likely sort, the new
folk over at Watters. They do say as you’re looking
round there, Mr. Lancaster. Time you got wed an’
all!”</p>

<p>Lanty laughed as he mounted.</p>

<p>“Oh, they’ve had me fixed up more often than I
could count, but it’s never come off yet! I’m over-throng
for that kind of thing, with the Government
setting me a different sort of sum every other week.
The estate’s my wife. I’ll never have any other.”</p>

<p>But, as he rode away, he knew that the real reason
had been left unspoken. True, the estate had the
whole of his heart at present, but it had not yet
claimed all his dreams. The Lady that had walked
between his box-borders was not forgotten, though
still yet to be found. The shadows would have to
lengthen further before he ceased to hope.</p>

<p>He would have no half-gods, this blunt, absorbed
business-man of the land. Thorough as he was in
every detail of his work, he carried the same demand
for perfection even to his private, human joy. It
had always been said of the Lancasters that they would
have the best—the best stuff, the best workmen,
the best methods, no matter at what cost. And the
last Lancaster of all added that, in little things like
love and marriage, he would also have the best—or
go wanting them.</p>

<p>He had had a very pleasant day in Manchester.
Hamer had treated him royally, and Dandy’s joyous
enthusiasm had shed brilliance over the expedition.
For once she had shown for him the rare sparkle that
she always kept for Wiggie. He had felt free and gay
and almost as young as she as they wandered round
the Show, tasting the charm of fellowship and mutual
interest, but even then it had failed as it had always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
failed before. He had told her that she must persuade
Hamer to take her to the Royal, and she had
mocked: “Cows and turnips!” passing on to show
rapturous interest in the latest type of plane. He could
not know that, five hours before, on the Preston
Road, she had decided that Hamer should certainly
take this very same party to the Royal. He only
felt like a turnip, and wished that his boots were
more like those of the nearest showman, and wondered
if he could possibly tolerate an overcoat with a waist
to it. And when they had turned their backs on the
city lights, she had wriggled from under the rug to
look behind her over the hood, and had sighed:
“Dear Manchester!” It had always been for her
a city of wonder and delight, paved and padded by
the genie-hands of Hamer’s gold, but there hung
no gleam of hard cash over it to-night, only the will-o’-the-wisp
lantern of new love. But Lanty remembered
the Thermos flasks and electric hair-curlers, and believed
that she turned sadly from the rich man’s
city, where such comforts were as common as dog-roses
in Westmorland. <i>He</i> would never have an
electric thingumbob in <i>his</i> house, he reflected savagely
and childishly. They had a Thermos flask already,
in spite of him, given to Helwise by Hamer, last
Christmas, and she had found it a glorious boon on
the servant’s day out, when she happened to want
a day out, too. Lanty had had many a cooped-up
cup of tea out of it, longing the while with a foolish
bitterness for a singing kettle and a fresh brew. The
Lady would never give him tea out of a Thermos—he
was certain of that.</p>

<p>The shock of Wiggie’s illness had laid the final
lever to the reopening gulf. During the following
anxious weeks, Dandy’s one thought had been for her old
friend, so that the new seemed completely put aside;
and the latter, hearing her self-reproach and seeing
her genuine trouble and anxiety, was more than ever
convinced that, in spite of their day together, she
belonged to the Wiggies of the world, and could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
never be rightly his. With a very little incense
she might be a half-god—his rebelling soul confessed
that!—but he did not mean to burn it. He would
swing no single censer, nor strew a single flower.</p>

<p>As he climbed out of the marsh on to the main
road, he met Brack in the Flanders. A church-bell
was ringing somewhere on the hill-side, and on
the empty seat at Brack’s left lay a Prayer-book.
When he saw the well-known figure, he pulled up
with a jerk that ground fierce complaint from his tyres.
Lanty looked at the Prayer-book in mild surprise, and
up to its owner. The angry colour flew into Brack’s
face, but he did not put out a hand to the strange
object. Let the d——d agent look if he liked!</p>

<p>When the colour faded, Lanty saw that he was thinner,
less superior, less exaggerated, less—well, less Brack.
The superciliousness that had marked him at the rent-audit
was gone, the splendid self-possession changed
to mere nervous defiance. His eyes were restless,
frightened. He looked as though, at any moment,
he might bolt like a startled deer.</p>

<p>Lanty stared at him curiously, with more contempt
in the curiosity than he knew. It was impossible
to take Brack seriously; the man must have dropped
a screw or two somewhere “across the dub.” The
Prayer-book alone, sitting blandly on the seat of the
car, stamped the situation.</p>

<p>Stung by his expression, Brack pulled himself
together with an effort, drawing out his cigarette-case
with shaking hands.</p>

<p>“Been looking out for you!” he began, coughing
to steady his voice. “Just come from calling at
Watters.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?” The agent raised his eyebrows. Was
Brack aspiring to that particular orbit? The younger
man flushed angrily once more.</p>

<p>“Westmorland Holliday blood need touch its hat
to no manufacturer’s cash, Mr. Lancaster!”</p>

<p>“Granted!” Lanty said heartily—“though it lifts
it to honest success!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>His manner changed, however. The little outburst
pleased him, coming as it did, not from vanity, but
from heritage, showing the man to be really one of
the old stock. He dropped into the coaxing tone
he kept for the long-time tenants. “Come, Brack!
What’s worrying you? Not the same old tale, man,
surely? You’re looking as nervous as a cat, and
more fit to be in hospital than driving a car.”</p>

<p>But Brack ignored the question, struggling with
his obstinate cigarette, and cursing under his breath
(despite the Prayer-book) as the wind took the flame.</p>

<p>“I went to Watters,” he continued, speaking
very carefully, “to see about this hotpot supper.
I went to tell Mr. Shaw I reckoned he’d better put
it off.”</p>

<p>“Put it off?” Lanty’s eyebrows went up again.
“What on earth for? Measles or something broken
out at the ‘Duke’? He must have thought you had
a pretty fair cheek! What did he say?”</p>

<p>“Say?” Brack raised himself in the car, shaking
suddenly with distorting rage. “He heard me right
out without bucking in once—all I’ve told you from
the start, and a bit more—and then he said what
the whole durned crowd of them say, every bright
boy among ’em, but what I reckon they’ll soon be
shutting their mouths on for ever and ever, Amen—he
said, ‘I’ll ask Mr. Lancaster!’ That’s the ticket—always
has been. ‘I’ll ask Mr. Lancaster. What a
Lancaster says, goes!’”</p>

<p>His hand fell accidentally on the Prayer-book, and
he quietened. The bell had ceased ringing up on the
hill. Lanty regarded him gravely.</p>

<p>“I know what you believe, Brack—it didn’t take
long to guess who sent that chapter out of the Bible—but
you can hardly expect us to believe it, too, just
on your word. You’ll admit it’s a queer story. And
what’s it got to do with the hotpot?”</p>

<p>Brack fiddled with the wheel, suddenly embarrassed
and distressed, his personal animosity fading before
the pressure of his inexplicable fear. His tale had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
run fluently enough to Hamer, a listener from without.
Before the agent’s steady contempt it fell to pieces.</p>

<p>“Dead woolly things!” he muttered, incoherent
and unintelligible; and other words completely lost.
And then again: “Wet little woolly things! <i>Dead!</i>”</p>

<p>Lanty might be forgiven for thinking that his
sudden religious mania had been backed by the
“Duke’s” ale. He touched up his horse, but Brack
put out a hand.</p>

<p>“I’ve just been slinging a word over the wire!”
he said queerly.</p>

<p>“Really?” Lancaster was wearying to get away.
“To the Clerk of the Weather, I presume?”</p>

<p>“No! Will you listen, if I tell you?” He leaned
forward eagerly, and then got his hands back to their
place as the sound of wheels warned him from the
near corner. Denny tore round it, and pretended
to have a heart-attack when he saw Brack.</p>

<p>“Danged if it bain’t the Judgment hissel! Runnin’
about in a motor an’ all!” He put his hands together,
and turned his eyes to heaven. “Give us a bit of
a prayer, Parson Brack, do!”</p>

<p>Livid, Brack snatched at the Prayer-book with
quivering fingers, and stood up.</p>

<p>“Guess you shall have it right now!” he cried,
and raised his hat. The book fell open instantly
at the Forms of Prayer to be used at Sea. By the
fierce rush of his words they guessed that he knew
the page by heart.</p>

<p>“O most glorious and merciful Lord God.... Look
down, we beseech thee, and hear us, calling out of
the depths of misery, and out of the jaws of this
death, which is ready to swallow us up! Save,
Lord, or else we perish. The living, the living shall
praise thee....”</p>

<p>His voice steadied as he read, the greatness of the
need taking hold, not only of the speaker, but of the
two men hearkening. Mechanically, Lanty put his
hand to his cap, and Denny awkwardly followed
suit. The last words came out quietly into calm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>“Stir up thy strength, O Lord, and come and help
us; for thou givest not always the battle to the
strong, but canst save by many or by few.... Hear
us thy poor servants begging mercy, and imploring
thy help.”</p>

<p>And Lanty, with his face turned to the sea, answered
“Amen!”</p>

<p>Denny passed him as he rode on, saluting him
with a lifted whip. His pleasant, uncaring face was
troubled and wondering. He met the agent’s eyes
with a question in his own.</p>

<p>Lancaster broke into a trot in the fair evening,
and, behind him, over the sea, there came up a cloud
no bigger than a man’s hand.</p>

<small>COMING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert Whinnerah</span> looked in at the door of the
little bedroom, and saw Lup standing by the window,
knitting his dark brows over a sheet of flimsy. The
yellow envelope lay on his bed.</p>

<p>“What’s amiss, lad?” He had seen him take
the telegram in, and wondered; and presently he
had followed him up. He was a tall, gaunt, white-bearded
man, with a look of Wolf about the eyes.</p>

<p>“Nay, I can’t make top nor bottom on it!” Lup
puzzled. “If there’s owt amiss, it’s the sort as doesn’t
bide shouting down a wire. It just says ‘Come
at once!’ with never a why nor wherefore to its
tail. ‘Come at once!’ Ay, yon’s all there is to it.”</p>

<p>“From Wolf? From your dad?”</p>

<p>“Not it! It’s from Bracken Holliday. You’ll
mind the Hollidays o’ Pippin Hall, I reckon? Well,
old Willie’s Brack’s uncle. He took him in an orphan
and tried to put him in the way o’ things, but Brack
was all for something fresh, and made off to Canada
afore he was sixteen. He raised money there an’
all—he’s smart in his way, is Brack—and then come
home to farm at Thweng. He’s in fine fettle, nowadays,
and as throng as a dog wi’ two tails, aping
quality and driving his own motor-car, but he’s
no friend o’ mine. That’s why I’m capt to reckon
up the meaning o’ this here.”</p>

<p>“Happen it’s a joke.” With Lup’s arrival, Robert
had fallen speedily to the use of the old words.</p>

<p>“Nay, I thought of that, but I don’t hold by it.
Brack thinks overmuch of himself for such-like daft<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
lakin’. Besides—I’d a notion he’d his own reasons
for wishing me out o’ the road.”</p>

<p>“Best wire your folk, asking if there’s owt wrong.”</p>

<p>Lup shook his head, folding the paper back into
its cover.</p>

<p>“I reckon nowt o’ wire-talk an’ trumpet-talk an’
such-like! Seein’s believin’, when all’s said an’ done.
I’ll gang myself. There’s a train somewheres about
midnight, isn’t there?”</p>

<p>Robert stared.</p>

<p>“You’re forgetting you sail to-morrow, lad, at
noon!”</p>

<p>Lup reached for his overcoat.</p>

<p>“Happen—if I’m not sailing across t’ Wythe
instead!”</p>

<p>“Ay, but your passage booked—your gear aboard!”</p>

<p>“Let ’em bide!” said Lup tranquilly, and went
out to the station.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>He was in Witham before seven o’clock. It was
a dreary morning, and offered to be a wild day.
Passing Hest Bank, he could both hear and feel a big
wind whistling in from the sea, and it was raining
heavily.</p>

<p>In Witham it was raining, too, and the wind ran
in fierce gusts up the narrow streets and down the
innumerable entries. Overhead was a sky like a
sodden blanket. He had his big coat, however,
and after some breakfast at the “Green Dragon,”
he went into the streets as they began to fill for
market, seeking news and a friendly lift out. One
after another of his acquaintances met him, open-mouthed
and incredulous, but from none could he
glean that there was anything wrong with his folk.
This man had seen them quite recently; that had had
news of them but yesterday, and so on. All was well
on the marsh—Pippin Hall and the rest. Ninekyrkes
still empty, of course. “What of Ladyford?”</p>

<p>This brought sly jibes from the growing ring of
farmers round the late deserter. “So <i>yon’s</i> what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
fetched tha back i’ sic a ter’ble scufter like, eh, lad?
Nay, now, there’s no use lookin’ as slape as an eel
tail! We ken all about it. Oh ay, Ladyford’s
snug enough. Here’s Michael to speak for hissel!”</p>

<p>Dumbfounded, Dockeray stared as at a ghost, but
when he had gathered his wits, had nothing different
to say from the rest. He urged the young man to
make some attempt to catch his boat, but could not
move him.</p>

<p>“Ower late, now,” Lup said, running his eye over
the wet street for Brack in vain. He had kept his
own counsel about the telegram, scarcely knowing
why. “I’ve missed it, right enough.” And as in
Liverpool, so he said in Witham: “Seein’s believin’!”</p>

<p>There was no sign of Brack all morning, but presently
he ran into Denny, who fell upon him in delight,
and cared not a rush what reason had brought him
back as long as he <i>was</i> back. To the dogged inquiry
he returned the common denial, but his usually
open glance shifted a little when Lup asked for Brack.</p>

<p>“Nay, he’s not in town this morning. Leastways,
there’s nobody clapped eyes on him yet. He’s a
bit rocky in the upper storey, nowadays, is Brack.
Going clean off his nut, I reckon!”</p>

<p>They had dinner together at the “Dragon,” and afterwards
he suggested that Lup should drive back with
him and spend the night at Lockholme. Dockeray
was for taking him to Ladyford, but Denny clung
jealously to his prize, and though Lup’s heart turned
to the latter farm, his courage shrank unmistakably.
He would go with Denny. If all was right at
the Pride, there was no haste till morning.</p>

<p>“There’s yon do of Mr. Shaw’s, to-night, at the
‘Duke,’” Denny went on, heartened out of his vague
doubts by the “Dragon’s” ale. “What d’you say
to going down? I’ll lay Mr. Shaw’ll be glad to see
you, and there’s Brack’s invite going begging, anyhow.
I hear he’s not for turning up. You can slip
over to the Pride first thing while morning. The old
folk’ll be feared to death if you come knocking at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
door to-night. If you can hang about a bit longer,
I’ll be through with my job, an’ then we’ll get out.”</p>

<p>After some hesitation, Lup agreed. He had had no
sleep, and was bewildered almost to helplessness by
the sharp turn of events and the puzzle of the situation.
He had a feeling that he ought to go with
Michael, but he did not know why. If he went now,
he could get over to the Pride before dark without
running any risk of alarming the old people, but if
there was nothing wrong, what would they think of his
sudden return, cropping up in this aimless manner,
having thrown away Ninekyrkes on the one hand,
and like enough his passage-money on the other?
Wolf would call him a fool. He began to feel a fool,
too—to wonder what could possibly have taken him.
Drink heartens some and depresses others. Lup
wondered and worried. Francey would have something
to say as well; unsaid, even, he would see
it in her eyes. In any case she would be certain
to think that he had come crawling back to her because
he could not keep away, and at that his Westmorland
pride took fire. The powerful instinct
that had drawn him blindly but surely so far, checked
in the last ten miles before the possibility of a woman’s
scorn. No! He would not go with Michael.</p>

<p>Yet, when Dockeray drove out, he watched the
retreating trap with something like a very agony
of desire to follow. He wanted to tear down the
crowded street and leap up behind; he could
scarcely hold himself back. But the Westmorland
farmer does not tear, especially after dinner on a
market-day, so he stood where he was, and let the
trap drop out of sight.</p>

<p>Waiting for Denny, he wandered aimlessly here
and there, stopping now and then for a chat under
some shelter, or to stare, with little interest, at a shop-window.
There was a hat he thought would look
a regular knock-out on Francey. It was of extensive
diameter, with two wild wings beating the air far behind.
The marsh wind would have taken it mightily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
to heaven, but he did not think of that. He
thought, though, of the gulls he had seen driving
inland in the dawn, as the night-train hugged the
edge of the wind-swept bay.</p>

<p>The confectioner next door had a window of cakes
with knobs running round them like castle-ramparts—Simnel
cakes they called them. Then it must be
Simnel Sunday—Mothering Sunday—to-morrow!
A slip of paper pasted on the wet pane informed him
that it was. The old custom was gone, leaving,
as in the case of so many customs, merely something
in the way of eating as its memorial. He remembered
hearing the parson preach about it, last year;
how the farm lads used to go home to their mothers,
taking flowers with them. Francey had been in the
choir, and they had driven home together. If he
slept at Lockholme to-night, it would be Mothering
Sunday by the time he reached the Pride. Seemed
appropriate, somehow. Perhaps, after all, he had
been right not to go with Michael—so he tried to
comfort the puzzle out of his heart. In any case,
he might take the old folk a remembrance of some
kind, even though it might not be over and above
well received, in view of the lost passage-money.
Shag for the old dad—that would do <i>him</i> all right!—but
his mother was a harder problem. He had
often heard her say she had all she wanted and a
bit over. After a while, he sneaked ashamedly into
the florist’s and bought some violets, large, dewy
and sweet. The girl watched with amusement as he
sank them gingerly into a capacious pocket. He
would put them in water at Lockholme, if he could
possibly escape Denny’s inquiring eye.</p>

<p>The boisterous wind that had roared through
the town all morning was still as high as ever when
they drove out in the late afternoon, calming no whit
even at the dead ebb of the tide, and it was raining
with the same steady violence. Crouching low
against it, Lup was glad that he had not to meet
it on the Northern marsh. He wondered if Michael<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
had got his horse to face the driving storm, or whether
he had had to trudge at its head—a weary-enough
job even for a young man. He had done well to stay
with Denny. Yet, at the first turn leading to the
marsh, he threw off the rug and put out a foot to
the step.</p>

<p>“I doubt I’d best be making tracks for home,
Thomas! It’ll be a bit of a drag across the moss,
but better now than when tide gets turned. We’re
in for a wild night, by the look of it, an’ there’ll be
no getting to the Pride after dark. It’ll be dark soon,
an’ all.”</p>

<p>Denny expostulated.</p>

<p>“Losh save us, man, you’ll never win out to the
Pride to-night! Light’ll be gone afore you’re at
Ladyford, and Mrs. Dockeray’ll never let you cross
door a second time.” He had set his heart on taking
Lup down to the supper, and, in spite of the rain,
was still aglow with “Dragon” confidence. “What’s
got you, Lup? You’re as queer as Dick’s hatband!
You’ve never Brack’s bee in your bonnet, surely?”</p>

<p>“How’s the tide?” Lup asked, unmoved.</p>

<p>“Sometime after midnight. Nowt to speak of.
There’s nobody looking for trouble on the marsh,
barrin’ Brack, as I said. Holliday o’ Pippin has yon
prize beasts o’ hisn down on the low land, an’ there’s
sheep in plenty out an’ all. Tide’s low, I tell you,
and it’s only been blowing since morn. We’ve seen
many a worse day, you an’ me. Come on with you,
lad! I tell you what it is”—he brought out the joke
that had been going round all day—“it’s yon lass
o’ Dockeray’s you’re after. We all know what skifted
you to Canada, but I reckon you found you couldn’t
quit, after all!”</p>

<p>And again Lup put his purpose by, yielding his
last chance for fear of a woman’s eyes.</p>

<p>The turn was passed, and Denny’s stepper, eager
for home, rocked over the bridge and along by the
towering wall of Doestone, which, with the swaying,
dripping trees facing, formed a darkening avenue in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
the quickening night. Then up the hill and sharp
to the right, sliding down towards the west. Once
on the low land, with nothing betwixt them and the
sea, the whole panorama of sky and sand lay blended
before them in one buffeted veil of gray, torn by the
sheets of rain. Only Denny’s voice kept the horse
to the wind, and now and again they had to draw
into a curve of the hedge for breath.</p>

<p>“We’ll fair catch it, coming back from the ‘Duke’!”
Denny observed, in one of these pauses. “But it’ll
likely blow itself out by daylight, an’ tide’s nowt,
as I said.”</p>

<p>They called at Thweng as they passed, at Lup’s
request, but Brack was not indoors. His doddering
old housekeeper, more than anxious to be shut of
them and back to the warm kitchen, told them he
was out somewhere on the land. Had he left a message
for one Lup Whinnerah? Nay, what he’d left a
parshel o’ messages for more than one body, and
the visitor could take his choice! Ya body was to
gang, an’ another body was to bide, an’ there was
summat about a motor-car an’ summat else about
wool, wi’ a bit o’ the Bible thrown in like, for luck.
T’ master’d talk t’ hind leg off a dog, any day, an’ if
they could mak’ owt of any on it, they were welcome.</p>

<p>The draught round the door was growing unbearable,
so she promptly banged it, and they withdrew, pondering.
Brack and his housekeeper seemed much of a piece,
and neither of them more than elevenpence in the
shilling. The conviction grew upon Lup that the
telegram, if not a joke, had at least been the outcome
of a mad obsession, and saw himself the laughing-stock
of the district. Whether he told or not, the outward
circumstances would never be forgotten—how
Lup Whinnerah turned tail on Canada at the last
minute, and ran home as hard as he could lick. Well,
Ladyford at least should have the laugh last. To-night,
Denny must see him through. He stumbled
thankfully into the warmth of Lockholme, and fell
asleep before the fire. Denny, trying to rouse him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
later, heard him muttering as he slept. “Wait of me!”
he was saying. “Mother! Wait!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>After infinite trouble, Hamer got Lanty on the
telephone towards one o’clock on that Saturday afternoon.
The agent was deep in deeds in some Witham
lawyer’s office, and excessively annoyed at being
snatched from them. Hamer, at the other end,
sounded anxious, and started badly.</p>

<p>Did Lancaster know it was raining?</p>

<p>Lancaster was safely under cover and furiously
occupied, and did not care a toss what it was doing
outside. Why should Mr. Shaw care—if he did
care?</p>

<p>It seemed he did. He recounted Brack’s conversation
of the day before—at least, as much of
it as Lanty would deign to receive—and found himself
cut off before the end of it. After five minutes’
patient waiting, the agent’s voice came back to him,
slightly breathless.</p>

<p>“I say, I beg your pardon! Saw a chap out of
the window that I mightn’t catch again for a month
of Sundays, so I just sprinted. I’m always pressed on
Saturday, so you must overlook it. By the way, it’s
raining more than a bit, as you say, and I’d no umbrella.
But I give you my word it’s not the Day
of Judgment or anything of that sort! You don’t
know our weather, yet; we’ve had such a fine year.
As for Brack, didn’t he strike you as being a little
off his chump? I’m rather anxious about him....
Why, no! Hotpot it for all you’re worth! They’ll
turn up, you’ll see. There’s nobody minding rain
in this district except Brack. Right! Thanks
very much. I’ll come over by the Lane. How is
Wigmore, this morning? ... That’s good. By the
way, Harriet turned in to the Board to-day for the
first time. Great doings, I hear! Put the Chairman
right on a matter of some cubic feet, and trotted
out a point of law that cleared up that supply
difficulty like magic, and left them all gaping. All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
the old hands are saying it’s like old times and John
Knewstubb over again. Harriet will shake them up
before she’s through!”</p>

<p>Hamer, still worried, observed that there was a
wind, and Lancaster groaned.</p>

<p>“My dear sir, it can’t always be summer! We’d
do badly if we didn’t get a wind now and then. It’s
to be expected, you know. Time o’ year. March.”</p>

<p><i>March!</i> The fatefully-returning word smote on his
ear like a blast. He hung up the receiver and stood,
thinking.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br>

<small>COME—THE GREEN GATES OF VISION:—V. THE
OUTER DARK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was dark when Brack got in, pitch-dark and
blowing the very roof off the world. He found his
housekeeper slumbering peacefully in the kitchen,
with a bottle of gin peeping coyly from under the
table. He shook her into some measure of wakefulness,
but coherence was beyond her. Ay, Lup
Whinnerah had called, sure enough, and kept her
yammering in a draught fit to blow the flesh off her
old bones. “Message? What-like message? Nay, now,
master, ye said nowt o’ t’ sort! T’ lad didn’t bide
long or say much neyther, barrin’ he’d happen look
in later. Ay, he’d a manbody o’ sorts wi’ him, but
I don’t mind who. It was ower black.”</p>

<p>She had let out a screech at first sight of the dripping
figure with haggard cheeks and staring eyes, and even
after he had thrown off his coat and emerged as the
elegant, somewhat ineffectual master she knew, her
fear of him scarcely lessened. He told her to make him
some tea, shooting out sharp questions as she dragged to
and fro, and swearing helplessly at the maddening
vagueness of her replies. When the tea came, he
drank it black and strong, and ate nothing, sitting
at the table with his wet hands locked, the flying
firelight on his white, strained face and drooped
shoulders. At every fresh blow of the gale he started,
and more than once he went to the door to peer into
the dark, looking for Lup’s form on the step, and
returning breathless from the fight with the entering
storm. As the hours wore on, he could not sit still
even for a few minutes together, but was forced to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
pace the flags, straining and listening, his restless
eyes on the banging windows and the shaking rugs,
coughing as the wind in the chimney drove great
clouds of smoke into the room. The housekeeper
had fallen asleep again, taking no heed of his mutterings
as he passed continually behind her.</p>

<p>The stock was safe, anyhow, up in those far pens.
Were they doing anything at Pippin?—Pippin,
on the very edge of the sand, hobnobbing with every
tide that ran in? Probably they were all gallivanting
off to the “Duke,” eating and drinking with that
Lancaster-worshipping fool from Watters. Was Lup
there, too, blind and deaf to the call of the storm?
and, if not, where was he? That was the torturing,
unanswerable problem. He’d never have come to
Thweng, though, if he hadn’t thought something
was up—why, he would never have left Liverpool
at all! What had that old hag <i>really</i> told him?
She might easily have given him the message, after
all, and forgotten all about it. If he had gone straight
to the Pride, Brack would certainly never set eyes on
him to-night. If, on the other hand, it was true
that he meant to call again, he might be here, any
minute. Should he wait, or should he go himself?
God! What was that? A fresh, tearing roar from the
gale drove him to a scream that brought the old
woman leaping out of her happy, drunken sleep.
He was struggling back into his coat, trying to control
himself. It had only been the wind, after all.</p>

<p>“I’m off out again!” he threw at her, tying
a scarf over his mouth to keep the force of the air
from choking him. “Come and bar the door after
me, and if you don’t stop awake with your eye on
that fire, you’ll sure be cinders in hell by to-morrow
morning! Do you take me? And if Lup’s round
again, tell him I’ve gone to the Pride!”</p>

<p>It took all their united strength to force the door
back when once it was open, and after the bolts were shot,
the old creature sank on the floor, shaking with long,
sobbing breaths. She could not hear what direction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
the master took, nor catch the note of the car as it
turned out presently through the yard. She could
only hear the song of the wind as it swept up from under
the door in a maniac scream, playing over her crouching
form like the gust of a thresher’s flail.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Within the cheer of Ladyford, the storm seemed
of less account, and there was no tide yet, washing
at its foot, to add the sinister dread of live water
close at hand in the dark and a flying gale. They had
known many a night as wild, though none worked
to such a pitch in so short a time; yet the women
looked anxiously at the clock, and wished Michael
safe back from the “Duke.” He had turned out
again reluctantly—nothing but an urgent business-matter
to be put to Lancaster would have dragged
him to Sandwath—and would have a bad time,
coming back. It was nearly midnight, now. He
should be home before long behind a horse who knew
his road like a homing pigeon; yet in the warmth
and jollity of the “Duke” the wildness without might
pass unfelt. Mrs. Dockeray fidgeted, sighed, set the
kettle boiling, stole a look at her daughter and sighed
again.</p>

<p>Michael had told them of Lup’s return, and, between
the three of them, thrash it out as they might, they
could make nothing of it. He seemed anxious about
his folks, but that hadn’t prevented him stopping
the night at Lockholme instead of coming on to the
far marsh. He’d no call to be anxious, either, unless
some busybody had been writing him lies. Happen
he’d taken boggle at the big ship and the far-off
country, but that wasn’t like Lup, who had always
found the hardest thing in life to be turning back
or changing his mind. Happen he was home-sick, or
just taking steck and no more; happen, and happen
to it. The riddle would not read, any way round.</p>

<p>Left alone, for young Rowly was in bed with a foot
sprained on the shore the night before, the two women
dropped the subject like a split egg, and wondered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
in silence, the mother glad and relieved, the girl
resentful, though longing. She knew now how the
dead ache of parting had weighed her down, but she
had no welcome for the knowledge. She did not
want him back, to begin the struggle again, yet hungered
for the sight of his face. Thinking he could
not leave her, she despised his weakness, yet fretted
because, having returned, he had nevertheless stayed
at the last mile.</p>

<p>He would not come in as he had come with Michael
so often, wet but cheery out of the night, filling the
house with a sense of safety, and stealing the fear
from the storm. Yet it might have been, if she had
not willed it otherwise. She might have sat in another
house, too, listening and longing for her man, and have
had Lup come back to her and her alone. But that
also she had rejected. She had put the dream from
her for always, but to-night it came every hour, passionately
and insistently real, though never in all her
life was it to come true on the Northern marsh.</p>

<p>Going to the window, as the two of them had gone
by turn for the last hour, she saw blinding lights
climb up the dark to the porch. They were too strong
and too low-set for the lights of the trap, as she
thought after the first instant, and even as she called
to her mother, Brack burst in at the door. He looked
distraught enough in truth as he stood with his shoulder
to the panel, the rain shining on his tossed, uncovered
hair, his brilliant, frantic eyes scouring the kitchen
as he asked for Lup.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dockeray exchanged a puzzled glance with
her daughter.</p>

<p>“Lup? Ay, Michael said he was back, setting
all Witham gaping, but he’s never got the length of
Ladyford. He’s to bide with Denny, isn’t he, after
the supper at the ‘Duke’? We’re not looking for
him to-night. Whatever’s set you seeking him here?”</p>

<p>“I thought he’d sure come right out.” Brack
turned as if to go. “No, I’ve never put eyes on him
myself. I just reckoned I’d look in on the chance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>“Have you heard what’s brought him?” she
asked curiously, and he shook his head impatiently.
There was scant time for talk, and less use. She
pressed him to a warm drink before leaving, but he
refused; then turned again, blurting out quick speech.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll trot on to the Pride! It’ll be bad
going, but I reckon I can get the car most there,
even to-night. She’ll come back smart enough,
anyway! I promised Lup I’d keep an eye on his
folks, and I’ve heard say the old woman used to funk
the tide something cruel. Guess she’ll be scared
out of her skin, to-night! If I can get them to move,
will you take them in?”</p>

<p>She stared again. This was not like Brack—this
unnecessary consideration and struggle for others.
She was amazed, too, at his agitation, the terror-stricken
eyes that would not meet her own, and the
ghostly echo of lightness over hollow fear.</p>

<p>“Why, Whinnerahs need never go wanting as long
as there’s Dockera’s, that’s certain! But they’ll be
to bed a while since, lad. You’ll never stir them.
They’ll not feel the wind over yon like us here. The
Lugg’ll break it a good bit. You’re never really feared
o’ the Lugg, as they make out? What, it stood yon
storm as tore up the front at Bytham, an’ t’other
as broke Cunswick Pier, ay, an’ many more! It’ll
stand to-night an’ all.</p>

<p>“You’ll never get Martha off the spot!” she
added, laughing.</p>

<p>“I must! I must!” Brack beat his clenched
hand on the door. “Guess you might come along
and help.”</p>

<p>“What? Me?” She laughed again, but with
less heartiness. Brack was so strange, so daft. “Nay,
I’d have all the breath out of me afore we’d reached
the first gate! Stop here, lad, and make yourself
easy.”</p>

<p>Francey stepped forward suddenly. Mad or no,
Brack had made her afraid.</p>

<p>“I’ll go!” she said. “We’d be happier with them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
here at Ladyford. Anyhow, we can see if they’re
all right and not anxious.”</p>

<p>Brack gave her no time to retract, but thrust her
roughly into a wrap close at hand, paying no whit of
attention to motherly protests, and had her out in
the yard before she had drawn the streaming ends
of her scarf around her head. Scrambling over her
to his seat, he bade her crouch on the floor for protection,
for the rain made the screen worse than useless,
and, moreover, he was afraid for it against the gale.
In the whirling dark he dared not reverse out, so
set the car head on to the gateway, trusting to luck
to turn her in the open road. With the wind behind
her, she took the slight gradient free like a greyhound,
and he threw in the clutch at the bottom just in time
to save her mounting the sea-wall. Then, with infinite
trouble and labour on the narrow track, he wrenched
her head round into the storm, the gale fighting
him all the time. Brack had done many a pretty
piece of driving for the impressing of his friends,
but to-night both vanity and pose were as far from
him as the black gulf of heaven above. Straining
and gasping, he pulled round on his road with a sob
of relief, not even conscious of the crouching girl
at his feet.</p>

<p>Then began the struggle out to the Pride, the engine
biting its way yard by yard through the opposing
force, often almost stopping, as an extra weight
of air drove upon it, but always gallantly picking
up again. Brack had learned to see through slashing
rain, like most drivers, but this torrent of wind and
water made as though it would hurl him off the face
of the earth. With numb hands he kept the car
on the road by some sense that seemed outside himself
altogether.</p>

<p>Francey, with her head buried on her knees, feeling
the striving engine growing hot and hotter beneath
her, and Brack’s feet moving beside her, wondered
what tremendous motive could have brought them
both to this shared nightmare. She remembered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
the former occasion when he had asked her to drive
with him, and she had refused, little dreaming of this
that lay before. In the comparative tranquillity
of Ladyford it had seemed easy to talk of going over
to the Pride. On a reasonable day it was no more
than fifteen minutes’ walk. To-night, behind a powerful
engine, it seemed as far away as Whitehaven.</p>

<p>She had little hope of persuading the Whinnerahs,
and, indeed, dreaded for them the shock of this
sudden midnight descent, but at least they would
know that they were not unthought of at their lonely
post. Did Brack really think that the Lugg might
go to-night? She remembered all the tests it had
passed, triumphantly as Wythebarrow itself. She
thought of the gale that had overthrown the Whitehaven
express in the dead of a black night on the
viaduct crossing the sands. The fury and passion
of that tempest had left the Lugg untouched, as had
many another. Why should Brack fume and fret
and struggle to reach the lonely house on the farthest
marsh? And—still more—why should she have
joined forces with him? Her heart gave her the answer.
She went to carry the news of Lup’s return. Whatever
they might say, however puzzle and condemn,
how glad they would be over the main fact, the three
of them together, father, mother and lover!</p>

<p>The road ceased suddenly, and they were on the
grass-grown trail leading to the Pride, the wheels
squelching and sticking on the sodden land; and at
once, by the lessened force of the wind, they knew
the Lugg to be risen at their left hand. They
were still swept and buffeted, but not with the pitiless
malignacy of the open, and the run along the difficult
waste was accomplished in less time than that on the
metal. So thick was the darkness, however, that
they did not raise the Pride until practically at its
door, and saw a warm-eyed window peer unblinking
into the immeasurable solitude. Through the unshuttered
pane they could see Wolf and his wife at
either side of the hearth, staring into the red cavern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
of magic and memory that was built between them.
The light of it fondled the old faces and shot along the
walls, turning steel to silver and copper to gold,
drawing the deep blues out of the china, and chasing
itself in molten streams along oak and stone. Only
the fire and the dogs stirred in that absolute, happy
peace of reaching back. The latter were plainly
uneasy, lifting themselves out of sleep with pricked ears;
and at intervals the older dog laid a wistful muzzle
on his master’s knee and cried softly. Then Wolf
would set a hand on its head without look or word,
and it would sink back to the hearth, yet keeping
its questioning eyes on his dreaming face. It was
a curious picture to be seen in the heart of a waste
that should by rights have been covered with rolling
billows, and to the watchers it had the effect of a
tiny gem on the mourning folds of a widow’s robe,
of a lost star in an illimitably shrouded heaven.</p>

<p>Brack’s knock broke the peace like a hammer,
and through the wind they heard the dogs bark,
springing, bristling, on guard. Wolf came presently
to the door.</p>

<p>He let them in at once when he knew them, for talk
without was impossible, but they found more bewilderment
than welcome waiting them.</p>

<p>What, for the land’s sake, had brought them out
on such a night at such an hour, scaring folks out
of their senses? Brack, exhausted with his fight,
was almost speechless, but Francey broke into the
kitchen with her woman’s wit alive and ready.</p>

<p>They’d been worrying about them at Ladyford,
she explained quickly. They felt lonely, somehow,
with Ninekyrkes at hand empty, and their old friends
such a way off. It was the first wild night for many
and many a winter that they had spent so far apart.
Brack had been calling with his car, so she’d taken
it into her head to come along with him to have a
look at them. Father was down at Sandwath, at Mr.
Shaw’s supper, or he’d have been over himself. And
there was news, too, clamouring to be out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>Kneeling between the dogs and spreading her cold
fingers to the flame, she told them of Lup’s return,
startling the whole neighbourhood by its apparent
lack of reason. Brack fidgeted in the background,
chafing to get at their chief cause for coming, but she
checked him with a look. There was only one way
of working to that.</p>

<p>Wolf dropped back into his chair, clinging to his
stick, interrogation, wrath and wonder stamped out
in turn by unwilling and sharply-suffocated joy,
but the old woman said nothing, smiling and staring
on into the fire. She did not even look surprised,
Francey thought. Had <i>she</i> summoned him back
at the last moment? How strange and reasonless
it all was! And what would be the end?</p>

<p>Catching Brack’s agonised glance of entreaty, she
went on hurriedly, laying her hand on the mother’s knee.</p>

<p>Lup was at the hotpot with Denny, but there was
more than a chance Michael would bring him back to
Ladyford. He’d never get out to the Pride to-night
on foot, and he’d be wearying to see them. Wouldn’t
they venture the short run in Brack’s car, in the hope
that he might turn up? Her mother was looking
for them, and with the wind at their back they’d not be
more than five minutes on the way. Like as not,
they would find Lup waiting on the doorstep. They
must wrap up warm, and with the dickey seat they
could manage, somehow. She could sit on the step.</p>

<p>She got no further than that, for Wolf growled her
into silence with the utmost fierce contempt, having
battered down his first delight. He was like to
gang scuttering off to meet yon wastrel as had ought
to be well loosed out o’ dock by now—ay, wasn’t
he! He’d see him strung afore he stirred a foot on
such a night to reach Ladyford or any spot in the
kingdom! The news could well have kept while
morning. They might have spared themselves their
trouble, and the sooner they were away and back at
home the better for all concerned. Mrs. Whinnerah
stared and smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>Brack broke in, then, bursting into a torrent of
entreaty and command.</p>

<p>“I’ll not leave you! I’ll not stir without you!
You’re sitting here snug and asleep, putting your
trust in your one-eyed Lancasters, and you’ll drown
in your trust like rats in a trapped hole! But it’s
up to me to see you don’t. I’ll hike you out, with or
without your will. I’ll get a move on you in spite of
you!”</p>

<p>He seized the old man by the shoulder, but Wolf
shook him off, striking at him furiously with his heavy
stick. Then he turned to the woman, stammering,
hysterical, almost weeping, his voice rising in desperate
appeal.</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> know what’s coming! I guess I needn’t
tell <i>you</i>! You know what the tide’s bringing, ’way
out on the dark sand! <i>You</i> hear it, same as I do,
what it’s seeking, what it sure means to have. It’s
all in for the Lugg to-night, and yet you’ll set your
life and his to foot the account, just to make good
on a Lancaster’s word, a Lancaster’s honour going
plum to hell for ever and ever and ever——”</p>

<p>He stuttered into silence before the smiling dreadfulness
of her eyes on his working face, and, when
he stopped, she turned them again with complete
and horrible definiteness to the fire. Wolf staggered
to his feet, the dogs close at his knee, half-crouched
to spring. Across Brack’s hand where he had struck
him the blood showed in a vivid streak.</p>

<p>“You’ll say nowt agen the Lancasters under <i>this</i>
roof, Bracken Holliday! We all ken the trouble
you’ve made on the marsh, and the tales you’ve set
agog about the Lugg and the old master; an’ I tell
you now, if it’s with the last breath God Almighty
puts into my mouth, that they’re every one on ’em
lies! The Lugg’ll last many a long year after us as
saw it built, an’ many a year after such as you an’
all; just as the Lancasters’ honour will stand, an’
their word an’ their righteous judgment, long after the
likes o’ you is mouldered away an’ forgot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>He tottered across to his wife and held out his hand
for hers.</p>

<p>“Wilta bide wimma, Martha?” he asked in a
dropped voice, and she looked up at him, resting
her gray head against his sleeve.</p>

<p>“Ay, lad, I will that!” she answered, in the same
tone of rarest intimacy, and he remembered in a
lightning-flash how she had spoken those very words,
in just that way, to his rough courting of long ago.</p>

<p>Cursing and sobbing, Brack tore out into the night,
calling to Francey to follow, and after a last look of
pity and pain she obeyed, the tears rolling down her
cheeks. In that moment all her theories and doubts
and surface convictions went by the board. Before
her eyes she saw made manifest the one thing that
holds human life safe and unafraid against all the unknown
terrors of the dark, and knew that to end it
thus with Lup, her hand in his, her cheek against
his arm, was to have for ever all of the very best
that God could offer.</p>

<p>The car went back as rooks go home on a slanting
gale. More than once Brack felt her slide up and off
the bank, on the other side of which lay the waiting
sands. And, as they fled, with the tempest-roar
in their ears, above it and behind them they heard
the voice of the coming tide.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Over the telephone, Hamer had offered to motor
Lancaster to the “Duke,” and the latter had accepted,
adding that he would walk to Watters by the short
cut. Driving home from Witham, his mind had been
so deep in ruts of law that he scarcely noticed the
increasing violence of the sinking day, but when he
left the house again about seven o’clock he was
appalled by its gathered strength. He wished now
that he had asked Hamer to send the car round,
but the Lane would soon take him, and he would
be sheltered under the tall hedges. Knowing the road
so well, he carried no light, and consequently stumbled
into Dandy in the pelting dark, feeling her way home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
in a state of abject misery. To his astonished questioning
she made answer in a voice very close on tears,
and she was more than a little cross. She had had a
trying experience, and even her beautiful temper
had snapped under the strain.</p>

<p>“I’ve been losing myself!” she explained, conscious
of sopping boots, clinging skirts, rat-tail
hair and tingling fingers, from which she had long
since cast away ruined gloves. He could not see her
here, but he would certainly see her in the hall at
Watters, and though, out of all heaven and earth
and any other stray universe, he was the one and only
person she wanted, she naturally used him as the
whipping-boy of her pent-up wrath and distress.</p>

<p>“I’ve come from Wild Duck. Harriet had gone
to Witham—perhaps you saw her—so I went over
to have lunch with Wiggie, and as I knew the car
would be out again to-night, I said I’d walk back. It’s
not so far, and I meant to be home long before dark.
However, Harriet was late in coming in, and I didn’t
like to leave Cyril alone with Stubbs (the nurse
was resting, and Stubbs talks him to death), so tea
was over before I got away. It was still light, then,
but very wet and blowing hard, so Harriet told
Stubbs to see me home, and we started off, but we
hadn’t got far before he announced that he wanted
to call at Rakestraw. He’d got it into his head that
it would do Wiggie good to go out in a bath-chair,
with himself to push, and he knew they had a bath-chair
at Rakestraw, which he meant to borrow. I asked
him if he couldn’t go some other time, but he said
no. No time like the present was his motto. It
had been his father’s motto. In fact, it was in the
family. Always in the family. I said that Wiggie
might not care about a bath-chair, but that, if he did,
Father would hire him the latest pattern from Manchester,
but he wouldn’t hear of that; and when
finally I suggested that he should go chair-hunting
by himself and let me go home, he wouldn’t hear of
that, either. He said that, coming from a town,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
I must naturally know all about bath-chair charges,
and he would want me to tell him what to pay if he
couldn’t get it borrowed. If I wouldn’t help, he’d
have to call for advice at the ‘White Lion,’ so for
Harriet’s sake I went. The Rakestraw people
dug the chair out of the barn, and said they’d be
delighted to lend it, and Stubbs was so overjoyed
that he started practising on it at once, with Newby’s
daughter as passenger. He’d evidently forgotten all
about me, so when I was thoroughly tired and chilled
to the bone I slipped out, hoping he’d go on practising
until I was safely away. Unfortunately, I took the
wrong turning and had to ask the road, as I
didn’t dare to go back. A boy told me to keep on
up the ginnel, and I’d strike a gate opening on to the
main road, so I rushed on without taking much notice
where I was going, until I’d lost the farm and everything
else as well. It was getting dark, by then, and every bush
looked exactly like every other bush, and I suppose I
went on walking round them, as I never found the gate
at all. I ginnelled and ginnelled and ginnelled <i>and</i>
ginnelled, but nothing ever ended anywhere. I found
all sorts of glades and walls and little woods and streams
I’d never seen or dreamed of before, and that I’m
perfectly sure are not there at all in the daytime, but
there was no way out. I felt just as if I were bewitched,
and all the bushes seemed like little stunted men
jeering and leering; and when it got quite dark I
was properly lost altogether. I was just getting ready
to die and deciding what I meant to say about Stubbs
at the Judgment, when young Newby ginnelled up
and found me. He’d thought he’d seen me wandering
about earlier, and was anxious in case I was really
lost, so hunted me up. He wanted to bring me home,
but I knew he’d to get down to the ‘Duke’ by eight
o’clock, so I wouldn’t let him. He’d only just gone
when you caught me up. They’ll be out of their
minds about me at Watters, and I shall probably
die there if not in the ginnel; but even if I don’t,
I mean to file that Judgment Bill against Stubbs!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>It was certainly quieter in the Lane, so that Lanty
was able to catch most of her troubled story, and
though he sympathised warmly, and reviled Stubbs
heartily, he could not help laughing, too, and when
he laughed she felt hurt, and wetter than ever.</p>

<p>“I’m frightened of your horrid country!” she
said miserably. “I’m sure there was something
queer about it to-night, anyhow. I felt as if it were
playing cat and mouse with me, and watching me
run round and round and yet never out of reach.
<i>Don’t</i> laugh! It laughed at me, too—I could hear
it—and the wind set all the bushes catching and
clawing at me as I passed. Young Newby says it’s
going to be the worst storm for years, and that he’s
very glad he’s farming inland—not on the bay. He
says that, after midnight, if it keeps on, the marsh will
be holding to its hair!”</p>

<p>A chill not of the striving elements came over
Lancaster. For the first time he thought of Brack
since Hamer’s call on the wire. Where was he to-night?
He had prophesied this storm, and prayed
over it. Was his madness really about to be justified?
He would know by the time he got down to the “Duke.”
If Brack was there he needn’t worry, though of course
he wasn’t doing anything so absurd. But if he wasn’t
there? Bluecaster too; not a sign of him all
day. Well, to-morrow he would laugh at all this!
In the meantime, he heard Dandy speaking again.
He had made no answer to her last words, but had
merely gone on splashing beside her without offering
to help her, probably with his head full of some stupid
farm-person she had never heard of. She thought
him more unkind with every minute that passed.</p>

<p>“It will be dreadful at Watters to-night, if the wind
keeps up!” she went on presently. “I shall lie
awake all the time, and shiver and shake. Watters
just purrs in a wind! You’d think it liked to feel
its joints cracking and its slates flying and the big
trees threatening it on all sides. <i>It</i> isn’t frightened
an atom, but <i>I</i> am. I never remember being frightened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
at Halsted. I wish we were back there. I
used to think I was getting to love the country, but
now I’m almost sure I hate it!”</p>

<p>In her vehemence she stumbled into the side, and
when he had picked her out again they could see,
grown accustomed to the dark, the straining blackness
of a giant tree beyond the still, black break in the hedge.</p>

<p>They could hear it groaning, too, above the storm,
and, in the sense of fearful battle and pain, felt it
as the impotent writhing of a soul in hell. In this
his Lane, where the magic set his fancy at full play,
Lancaster wondered what the soul really felt, the
impotent, lost soul? As Dandy had said, there were
strange things abroad to-night.</p>

<p>“I doubt the old shippon at Pippin will never
stand,” he said absently, thinking all the time of
the soul, and scarcely for an instant of the shippon,
and started when she uttered a sharp little sound
of misery and contempt.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, but may we go on? No doubt it is
very important, but I’m afraid I’m too wet and tired
to care!”</p>

<p>He begged her pardon instantly, and then, because
behind the shippon had been all his anxious thought
for the men of the marsh, “You don’t understand,”
he added quickly. They were the opening words
of much that he wanted to tell her, seeking comfort
from her and strength; but she could not know that,
and she did not wait to learn.</p>

<p>“No, I do not understand!” she said passionately.</p>

<p>“I am an outsider, and you always take care to
make me feel it. Very well. I will remain outside.
And I do not wish to understand.”</p>

<p>They trudged on in silence, and after she had again
walked into the hedge he offered her his arm in a
detached voice that might have come from the nearest
stump. She took it without answer. On her wet
cheek the wind could tell no difference between salt
tears and the rain.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>In spite of the weather and the busy season, the
men turned up fairly well at the “Duke,” making
light of their wet drive. Some of the elders were
absent—Holliday of Pippin, for one; but his sons
were there, and Dockeray’s arrival from the far
marsh was greeted with applause. He drew Lancaster
into conversation at once, and, almost immediately
after, attention sprang to Denny, leading in Lup with
the swagger and importance of a hen with a single
chick. The latter met the general curiosity with the
defensive imperturbability he had shown all day;
only, when Lanty came to him wondering, he asked
for Brack. He saw the agent start, and the eyes of the
two men met in a dumb perplexity, almost as those
of trapped creatures walked stubbornly to the same
snare. But neither Lancaster nor anybody else knew
anything of Brack, save his late church-going mania,
though they had plenty to say about <i>that</i>. As they
sat down at the long table, his name was shuttle-cocked
from mouth to jesting mouth.</p>

<p>It was just about the time that Brack burst in at
Ladyford that Bluecaster came into the “Duke”
and opened the supper-room door. The warm air
was full of light and comfort, smoke, fellowship
and song. The “Duke” stood well protected by
the surrounding buildings, so that the storm was not
only shut out, but forgotten. His lordship came to
the head of the table and shook hands with Hamer.
At the far end, Lancaster stood up.</p>

<p>Bluecaster looked round the assembly with his
shy, appeasing smile. His face was rather pale,
but his voice was even quieter than usual.</p>

<p>“Are there many sheep out on the mosses, to-night?”</p>

<p>After the first stare of wonder, anxiety rolled like
a wave from one face to another, each looking into
each and back again to his lordship, and then the
answers broke round the table: “Twenty in t’ lower
meader—fourteen on t’ middle moss—nay, I’ve all
mine penned—seventeen—ten—why, what’s the stir?
Storm’s nowt, is it?”</p>

<p>Holliday’s lads got up and looked at the door,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
remembering the precious stock on the lowest land
of all. Other men followed their example. Only
Lup sat on, with his eyes fixed on Lanty.</p>

<p>“The tide is for one o’clock,” said Bluecaster.
“The wind may bring it earlier. It will be a big
tide.”</p>

<p>He said no more, but the room emptied as if by
magic, the men jerking their good-nights over their
shoulders as they went on.</p>

<p>“You will forgive me?” the intruder said to the
host. Outside, he motioned Lancaster into his car.</p>

<p>“Pippin!” he ordered, “and——if we can get there,”
he added, under his breath. The agent looked at
him.</p>

<p>“Is it coming?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It is here,” said Bluecaster.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>As Brack caught the dread sound that had risen
so often through his tortured dreams, he uttered
a cry of such agony that Francey shrank beside him.
Thrusting her out at the gate of Ladyford, he leaped
after her to the ground and stood straining into the
dark over the sea. Then suddenly he began to run
in the direction from which they had come, gasping
and beating against the air in a fresh effort to get
back to the Pride. But before he had gone a hundred
yards, he saw ahead of him, towering over the Let, a
white mountain of water as if the whole of the tidal
wave had swerved and mounted its barrier. On a
screamed prayer he turned and raced for his life
with the monster behind him, and, as he reached
the gate, a galloping horse and rocking trap burst
past him into the yard, a flood also at its heels. The
water poured after them up the slope, and above
the shriek of the wind they heard the roar of the full
tide as it swung on and past to the top of the bay.</p>

<p>In the kitchen, the frightened women and the
roused hands were busy moving food and valuables
as the sea came in at the door, until presently it was
standing two feet deep on the flags. Michael and
Lup (for they had driven together) came in at the back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
after they had stabled the horse, and a short consultation
was held in the larder, raised by stone steps
above the level of the kitchen. Brack had sunk into
a kind of stupor in a corner.</p>

<p>“The banks are giving on all sides!” Michael
said, as the household crowded round him. “We
were near caught time an’ again as we came along.
The water kept bursting through behind us before
we were barely clear. The marsh-road’s gone—ay,
an’ the main road an’ all, I doubt! There’s a gap
like the mouth o’ hell just below there where we
galloped in. The Let’s going all round the marsh,
but the Lugg’s not gone yet!” He looked at Lup,
rigid and silent, and went on slowly. “I feel somehow
we’d know right off if the Lugg went.”</p>

<p>Young Whinnerah nodded. He had not looked at
Francey since he came in, nor attempted to question
Brack. The time for wonder was past.</p>

<p>“I must get out, some way,” he said. “I must
learn if they are safe. Happen it’d be possible back
o’ t’ house, over the land. Which of you’s game to
come along?”</p>

<p>They were all game—no question about that—and
the women made no protest. Storm and tide
were no new things to the folk of the marsh, and in
this case friends of tried worth were in peril out in the
night. Brack dragged himself up, and joined the rest
as they furnished themselves with sticks and splashed
across the yard to the drier land. He had done his
share already, but that did not keep him. His car
was sunk in a swirling torrent, but he never thought of it.
Through the web of conceit which had sealed his heart
to his kin, there had sounded at last the call of
the clan.</p>

<p>They formed a human chain and groped, with the
big sticks scouting before them, in imminent danger
all the time, and more than once utterly bewildered
and all but lost. Wading often to their waists, trapped
by deep holes, by wire fencing wrenched into sunk
snares for their stumbling feet, blinded, dripping,
breathless and stunned, buffeted by the wild gusts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
and clouds of spray beating in through the mighty
breaks in the bank, they yet held on until there seemed
to stretch before them a limitless expanse, and knew
that the floodgates at Ninekyrkes must have smashed.
For long enough they tried to get round, but in vain,
and at last, in the same perilous fashion, they struggled
back to the house. All over the marsh men were
doing the same, risking their lives for news of each
other’s safety, or in attempts to rescue stock, counting
it all as just so much in a bad day’s work.</p>

<p>In the big bedroom upstairs, the women had
lighted a fire and set food, and called the weary band
to it. Michael, the old man, heartened himself to
hearten the rest.</p>

<p>“The Lugg’s standing,” he said more than once.
“I tell you we’d know right off if the Lugg went!
It’ll hold its own as it’s always done. It’ll win
through this lot an’ all.”</p>

<p>And Brack held his peace.</p>

</div></div>

<p>At the Pride the fire sank a little, and the dogs
grew more restless with every five minutes that passed.
The clock on the stairs struck half-past one, and Wolf
stood up stiffly.</p>

<p>“Time we were abed,” he said.</p>

<p>She looked up at him for a minute without moving.
She would have preferred to stay where she was,
gleaning a little false assurance of security from the
red coals, but, after all, what difference could it make?
She raked out the fire after her usual custom, and
Wolf turned the lamp to a dying flicker and lighted
the bedroom candle. The whittering flame caught
their son’s eyes looking down under drawn brows
from the mantel, and they stared at him together in
silence. At that very moment Lup was fighting to get
to them in vain, and all the way his heart was saying the
same words: “Wait of me, Mother! Wait—<i>wait</i>!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>There was no change in the wildness of the night;
only, upstairs, it seemed more apparent. The frightened
dogs scratched and howled at the bedroom door
until it opened, when they fled under the bed and lay
shivering and whining in mortal fear. The old clock
beat steadily on the stairs. A shrieking gust tore at
the window as the old couple knelt at the bedside
for their evening prayer, but they were not afraid.
In the little kitchen, Love had wrapped them round
with a golden moment from the past, but here a higher
angel spread protecting wings.</p>

<p>The roar of the night increased suddenly in volume,
and after it there came the special voice that had
called the whole trembling marsh to listen—the
voice of the sea. And, as if listening also, in the
middle of its steady swing, without whirr or warning,
like the last, soft, never-repeated breath of the gently-dead,
the clock stopped.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>His lordship’s car never got to Pippin.</p>

<p>About one o’clock, old Willie woke as if a finger
had touched him, and struck a light. He had barely
flung on his clothes before the tide had leaped the
bank and swung round the farm like the turning
flow riding a stranded yacht. By the time he had
roused his wife and daughter, the water was in the
house, half-a-dozen feet on the ground floor and climbing
the stairs. The elder woman crouched on the
bed and wept for her best parlour furniture, bumping
below like rocked boats anchored aside; but Holliday
thought of his prize beasts drowning in their pens, of
his ewes choking in the fields, and—lastly—of his lads
racing home against the sea. Would they trick the
tide? And more—if saved themselves—would there
be any home at all for them by morning?</p>

<p>He guessed what had happened. The river Wythe,
semi-ringing the farm, had been in flood all day,
and, meeting the driven tide, had flung terrific pressure
on the whole of the marsh banks. Here and there
they had quickly burst, letting the tide through,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
and Pippin had been taken in its first stride. From
the top of the stairs he watched the water, wondering
how long it would continue to rise, and listening to
his wife’s lamentations over the parlour carpet. He
let her alone, though he knew all the provisions in
the house were gone, and that they were cut off from
help on all hands. What he did not know was that
in the bank outside was a gap a quarter of a mile
wide, but if he had known he could have done nothing.
He could only watch the water creeping up.</p>

<p>His daughter came out to join him, and leaned a
second light over the sliding, heaving enemy below.
When it had passed by six inches the Great Tide-Mark
on the stairs, recording the big storm of his
childhood, he remembered suddenly how he had
denied his nephew in the flooded room below. Brack
had said this would come, and they had none of them
believed or cared.</p>

<p>Now the water was three stairs from the top. Stooping,
he could touch it. Each stair was a foot wide, and
the black water over the black oak seemed to hold
the depth of the bottomless pit. When it reached
the third step it stayed as if uncertain, listening,
waiting for some ghostly order from without. The
light gleamed along the yard of shining baluster rising
from the well, lending a silvery whiteness to Holliday’s
bent head, and the shimmer of gold to his daughter’s
drooping plaits. With strained, almost inhuman
faces they leaned above their doom, waiting, as the
water waited, for a fate that hung in the balance.
And at last, after incredible years, something happened.
Holliday let out a hoarse cry that rang through the
house, and father and child, staring into each other’s
eyes, read the same flashed message of sickening
horror and passionate relief. The tide had dropped
a foot in sixty seconds.</p>

<p>They fell on their knees, shuddering, and Holliday
spoke.</p>

<p>“T’ Lugg’s brast!” he said. “Whinnerahs is done.
T’ Lugg’s brast!”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawn</span> saw a boat-load of haggard faces under the
walls of the Pride. There was water as far as eye
could see, and the grim light filtered through six great
gaps in the bank. The Let had given in all directions,
and from Watch How the whole Wythe valley showed
like one vast lagoon.</p>

<p>Lup stood up in the stern to hail, and found his
voice a dead thing in his throat. All night long it
had been calling, but it was dumb, now. In his
pocket his icy fingers crushed the forgotten violets
meant for his mother.</p>

<p>Lancaster, at an oar, looked up at his terrible face,
and shivered. Somebody called, and they rowed
closer. Across the sill of an upper room the wind had
blown the silvery strand of a woman’s hair. They
hailed once more, and drew towards it; but when
they saw the watermark, they were silent.</p>

<p>So, on Mothering Sunday, Lup Whinnerah came
home again.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br>

<span>ONE MAN’S WORK</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a strange and fearful world that lifted its
mangled face to the growing day. The wind was
still blowing, but with less violence, and the rain
drifted in a kind of desultory fretfulness between the
weary grays of earth and sky. From all the districts
round folk had come to see what the storm had made
of the marsh, and the wreck of Lancaster’s Lugg had
sped on wire and rail through the country. On all
hands men were at work saving what they could of
the remnant of stock; here, a sheep crawled on a
fence within a few inches of the reaching water; there,
cattle still deep in it long after noon had struck.
Pippin Hall was completely surrounded, but friends
had crossed the swollen river with food, and from an
upper window Holliday asked shakingly for news of
the Pride. Pippin had lost almost everything it could
lose—ewes, new lambs, calves, poultry, stacks, turnips,
mangolds, carts—and had half a ruined house to top
the account. Only, by some miracle, the prize beasts
had been saved. Standing up to their necks, half a
mile from dry land, they could only be approached by
boat, and the difficult and dangerous rescue extended
far into the afternoon. Poor Denny had lost a valuable
horse as well as half his flock. Nearly every farm had
suffered with its sheep, and the “dead, woolly things”
of Brack’s prophecy covered the marsh.</p>

<p>On the sea-roads the water rose level with the hedges
all day, and, when it left, the scars of the land crept
shudderingly into sight. Great holes five and six
feet deep where had been metalled surface, uprooted
fences and railings twisted like cord; and everywhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
dead things, rabbits, hares, poultry—and always sheep.
The peaceful, cared-for country lay broken and horribly
disfigured, as if by the riving hands of a maddened
giant.</p>

<p>And over it all—gray; the gray of desolation, of
cowering shame, of finished defeat and despair.</p>

<p>Lancaster stood in the wet kitchen at Ladyford, and
stared at his wrecked world. He looked utterly
changed, years older, stunned and almost wondering,
like a man struck from empty skies. His face and
hands were blue with cold, and his wet clothes clung
to him soddenly. Before him he could see the Lugg
heaving out of the clearing sands, and the Pride still
girthed in flood—guard and trap, betrayer and betrayed.
In the room above him he could hear footsteps,
hushed and slow. The Pride had given up its
dead that Ladyford might take them in.</p>

<p>Lup was dropped at the table with his head on his
arms, and opposite him Francey stood stiffly, white
as the new scrubbing-stone on the hastily fettled
hearth. When Lancaster turned from the window
with a definite movement, Whinnerah lifted his face
and looked from him to the girl. So, to the slow
music of the hushed steps, they stared at each other,
the three who had sent the proud old couple to their
doom.</p>

<p>“They went on my word!” Lancaster said at last,
in a curious voice. “I wonder if they forgave me
before they died?”</p>

<p>“They went because of <i>me</i>!” Francey put in
passionately. “They could have stopped at Ninekyrkes,
but I drove them out. They went because
of <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>And though he was right, she was right, too. Far
away, far back had been sown the seed of this trouble,
when an upright, loving pair had put their savings to
the bettering of their only girl.</p>

<p>But Lup denied them both with a sharp gesture full
of the dignity of possession.</p>

<p>“They were my folk—not yours. If I’d stopped,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
they’d be here to-day. They were my folk, and I
drowned them!”</p>

<p>And he also was right.</p>

<p>Yet Lancaster, listening, knew that from the leader
and not the led is toll exacted, on the head and not
the hand is judgment passed. This debt was his,
this judgment his. The two had been but tools in the
carving of his fate.</p>

<p>He saw Lup sink back, and Francey fall to her knees
beside him, and he went out and shut the door. They
would mend their broken lives together, but he was
alone.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Michael ferried him to a point from which he could
reach an untouched road by means of climbing fences
and skirting meadows. The day was fading into quiet
and dusk with the death-exhaustion more terrible
than the height of wrack and pain. The trouble that
was passing was physical, rending the body and
stupefying the mind. The trouble that followed was
the still, corroding trouble of the soul.</p>

<p>Behind him the Lugg, broken monument and
draggled standard. Behind, the Pride, tomb of more
than human flesh. Before him, Pippin, with the
water still at its door, and the stretch of ruin around.
With the marks of the long hours upon them, agent
and tenant parted on the soaking grass.</p>

<p>“Don’t fret yourself overmuch, sir!” Michael
said earnestly. “It had to happen. It was nobody’s
blame. It had to come.”</p>

<p>And all across the marsh he met men who said the
same, men spent with giant exertions, who had lost
heavily, and saved even their lives only by sheer good
luck.</p>

<p>“It had to be, sir! It’s bad, but it might have
been worse. If the Lugg hadn’t given, the whole of
the top marsh would ha’ went, and that would have
settled a deal more folk than just two. There wasn’t
room for a tide such as yon. Why, it was like to
have taken the whole Wythe valley! It wasn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
anybody’s blame. Who would have looked for such
a flood, and that sharp like? The Lugg had been a
smart bit of framing, and had done its best. There
were volcanoes and such-like abroad, ready to brast
up any minute, but that didn’t stop folk building nigh
’em. With luck, the Lugg might have stood another
fifty year. It was nobody’s blame.”</p>

<p>And not one of the well-meant words lifted the load
an atom, or carried a shade of comfort home. It had
been his choice, and he had chosen wrong; his team,
and he had pulled the wrong rein. This thing had
happened in his time, this record would be written
against his name. The cheering words went with
the wind. And as he turned for the last time to look
behind, seeing always the faces of the newly dead,
there came over him a hard rage against the man who
had tied his hands with his plans and his pride. He
cursed his father as he stood on the wrecked shore,
and in that loss of faith fathomed the darkest depths
of all.</p>

<p>His circumambulatory journey took him past
Thweng, and, done though he was, a sharp impulse
turned him to its door. Within, he found Brack and
Denny, and, seated at the kitchen table, Bluecaster.</p>

<p>For more than a dozen hours he had forgotten
Bluecaster completely. They had lost each other in
the dark, and had gone to help, one at one farm, the
other at another. He had thought of the whole
matter as his own, and wondered at himself now even
while he clung to the thought, for here was the real
master. Yet, had Bluecaster ever been master?
Again, as at Ladyford, he recognised that always the
leader paid.</p>

<p>“You <i>knew</i>?” Denny was saying, half-fearful, but
resentful and distressed. “Nay, you’re just getting
at us! You <i>couldn’t</i> know.”</p>

<p>“I <i>did</i> know!” Brack answered wearily. “Guess
I might as well tell the table, though, for all the understanding
I’d get. I played myself out trying to make
you see square, but there was no getting past that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
bleat of yours about the Lancasters. Well, I reckon
you’ve got your head in your hands, this time! Keep
to your bleating and see what you’ll get, next. Seems
to me folks that don’t bleat aren’t wanted any on
Bluecaster—folks with their eyes skinned ahead. For
I knew—that’s sure!” He paused suddenly. “And
his lordship knew!” he added.</p>

<p>“No,” said Bluecaster.</p>

<p>Brack swung round with a piercing look and opened
his lips, but Bluecaster kept his eyes steady with an
effort. Lanty stepped into the room.</p>

<p>“I thought you’d have been gone long since, my
lord! They’ll be getting anxious at the House. Can
you drive us home, Thomas?”</p>

<p>Denny turned with quick gladness on his poor,
troubled face.</p>

<p>“Ay, that I can, sir, though I’ve lost the best horse
in my stable!” He reached out and laid a hand on
Lanty’s arm. “There’s folks, sir—none so far off,
neither—as say the Lugg ought never to have been
built, folks as think ’twas pride as put it there and
pride as kept it there. But there’s other folks as say
the Lancasters may build a score o’ Luggs an’ drown
the lot of us; an’ the fust on ’em’s Thomas Cuthbert
Dennison o’ Lockholme!”</p>

<p>He hurried out, leaving Brack staring curiously
after him.</p>

<p>“What’s the cinch you’ve got on ’em all?” he
asked at last. “What’s the receipt for making blind,
boot-licking fools of thinking men, setting them kissing
your feet and your kid gloves? How have you fixed
these kow-towing cranks on the marsh?”</p>

<p>Lancaster came forward to the table.</p>

<p>“There’s only one tie, Brack, between man and
man, that will stand a week, and that’s just simple
faith. You think we’re out of date up here because
some of us still trust each other, still hold a man’s
word as his bond, unbacked by a Government stamp.
You think that folks should trust themselves and
nobody else, should keep looking out all the time for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
other folks getting ready to do them. Now, <i>I</i> tell
you, who have seen my own faith go down to-day—<i>I</i>
tell you, it is better to keep trust and be betrayed—ay!
better even to betray trust in keeping trust,
than never to have trust at all! What you knew,
you knew of yourself; it could not help us. We at
the helm had to take our chance, and failed. Do
not doubt that always, and in every way, we shall
pay.”</p>

<p>A flush came into Brack’s haggard cheeks. He
gave a short laugh of pure nervous excitement. He
straightened himself. His elegance came back to
him. You looked instinctively for the Trilby and the
S.-F., though both had been swept out to sea. He
stepped in front of Lanty, clicking his heels together,
and flinging up a hand in salute.</p>

<p>“Mr. Lancaster, you’re great!” he exclaimed, at
his most colonial. “You’re the real goods, all the
way. You’ve got me, any time you like. I’ll take a
top line, please, in that drowning-list of yours, along
with friend Thomas Dennison!”</p>

<p>He gave the same nervous laugh and went out. But,
as he went, he cast one last keen and curious glance at
the young man at the table.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Sit down, won’t you?” Bluecaster said. “Dennison
will be some little time yet. You look thoroughly
done up.”</p>

<p>Lanty took the chair opposite. They were both
tired out, but there were things yet to be said, things
that might never be possible, perhaps, on any other
day but this.</p>

<p>“I spoke for us both, my lord. If I took too much
on myself——”</p>

<p>Bluecaster lifted a hand.</p>

<p>“You have always had to take everything. It
isn’t the first time. I have never helped you. Do
you think I don’t know it?”</p>

<p>“That’s not true!” Lanty answered warmly.
“How could I achieve anything without your consent?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
In the end, everything comes to you, and
you’ve never hindered. There’s no better landlord
in the kingdom.”</p>

<p>“It’s easy to be kind without lifting a finger; easy
to agree to a judgment you know to be right; but
there’s a final responsibility that is mine and mine
only, and that I’ve never faced. In this matter of
the Lugg, for instance——”</p>

<p>There came to Lanty a memory of the meeting at
which, with a single look, Bluecaster had passed the
fate of the bank into his hands.</p>

<p>“Of course you couldn’t know!” he exclaimed
incredulously. “That’s only Brack’s raving. But”—he
stopped suddenly, stared, stammering and half-rising—“you
don’t mean that you agreed with him,
thought the Lugg ought to go—did not trust it, all
the time?”</p>

<p>Bluecaster bowed his head without reply.</p>

<p>“You thrust the problem on me, convinced in your
own mind of the one right course—bade me answer
for us both, unjust as it was, biased as you knew I
must be, certain that my answer would not be yours?
I took it that you had no opinion, could not and would
not choose. For that reason only I stepped into your
place. Have I failed so far in my duty that you dared
not set your will against mine?” Doubt assailed
him, the fearful doubt besetting the strong of the unconvincedness
of the consenting weak. “My lord—was
it <i>that</i>?”</p>

<p>“No, it was not that,” said Bluecaster.</p>

<p>“It must have been! I thought you wanted help—but
it was that.”</p>

<p>“It was <i>not</i> that!” Bluecaster spoke very firmly.
“Sit down again, man, and listen to me. We’re
neither of us fit to see very clearly to-night, but I
want to get this said. You’ve never bullied me—don’t
worry your head about that. You’ve been the
stronger man, that’s all, and you’re suffering for it.
It’s always unfair on the servant to be the stronger
man. But sometimes”—he smiled his pleasant smile—“sometimes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
Lancaster, old man, the master is jolly
glad of it!</p>

<p>“I’d always thought the Lugg might be a menace
to the top marsh. The neck of the bay is so narrow—it
used to look to me as if the Lugg was choking it.
And, like Brack, I’ve seen storms—one does see things
knocking about as I do,” he added half-apologetically,
the idle, rich traveller to the home-keeping worker.
“And the reclaimed land always made me creep a bit.
It looked so—well—<i>snatched!</i> I’ve a fear of the sea,
although I’ve been out on it so much in all sorts of
cockle-shells. It always has something in hand.
You may trick it, but it generally gets its own back
in the end. And though I know all the marsh has
been fought out of it, yard by yard, it seemed to me
to have a queer kind of grudge about the land behind
the Lugg. I’d have been glad to see it go, and that’s
the truth! But then—your father had built it, and
I’d been brought up on the things your father did.
They used to call him the Big Man of the North.
<i>He</i> said the Lugg would stand, and it did, long after
he wasn’t there to see that it was doing as it was told.
Then <i>you</i> came—as good a man as your father—<i>yes!</i>—and
said the same thing, and I kept quiet. All the
marsh knew my opinion wasn’t worth the flick of a
whip against yours. If I’d touched the bank, they’d
have taken it that I meant to slight you, and I would
have cut off my head rather than do that. See?”</p>

<p>He smote the table suddenly with his clenched
fist.</p>

<p>“God! What a liar and a coward I am! That’s
all lies—you know it, don’t you, Lancaster?—no—not
lies, perhaps, but side-issues. The truth is, I was
afraid, as I’ve always been afraid when it came to a
big shove. I shirked having to speak out, having to
decide, so I put it on to you. I knew <i>you</i> wouldn’t be
afraid, that you would take the straight path as you
saw it. I knew you’d shoulder things for me, as you’d
always done. You must have despised me often; and
yet I don’t think that, somehow. But I’d despise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
myself more than I do if I didn’t feel that they’ve given
me overweight to carry—the powers up above that
fix our place for us down below. I wasn’t meant to
handle men. It isn’t my job. I shouldn’t have been
slung up like St. Simon what’s-his-name on his pillar.
I was cut out a quiet, retiring, harmless individual
with a taste for sailing and rather a good eye at tennis,
and I’m expected to be a symbol, a father-confessor,
general caretaker, referee and prop of the State! I
haven’t been any of all that except in spurts. You’ve
had to be it for me; but in the end it all comes back to
me. It’s slated down to my account. The responsibility’s
mine. It isn’t that I don’t love the place and
the people, and the feel of it all belonging to me, but
those of us who stop to think what it means are paying
for it all the time, even chuckle-headed idiots like
myself. Do they never realise—these men who are
always going for the landlords—that power and place
have to be paid for, and in bitter coin? It all looks
so easy from the outside; but it’s loading a horse a
ton too much, setting a seasick chap to furl the tops’l,
when it comes to poor beggars like me!</p>

<p>“But you’re clear in this,” he added presently.
“The final responsibility’s mine, as I said. It’s I
who will have to face the music for those lost lives when
the bill comes in.”</p>

<p>Lancaster shook his head without lifting it from his
hand where he had leaned it, listening.</p>

<p>“I took the responsibility from you. I need not
have done it. I could have refused it. But I didn’t
refuse. This is <i>my</i> work.”</p>

<p>And, as at Ladyford, so here, he saw clearly that,
in every crisis, one particular soul holds the scale.
Bluecaster was right, as Lup and Francey had been
right, but there was a more stringent law beyond. The
words that had haunted him all day came back to him
now with redoubled force. “It is always one man’s
work—always and everywhere.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI<br>

<small>HIS SILLY HOME</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> dropped from the trap at his own gate, and
walked up the drive. There had been no sound of
his coming, so the door was not open, and the lack
of welcome hurt him somehow, as if the house meant
deliberately to shut him out. He did not come to
it as to a place of healing, but at least it was his own
hole to creep into when wounded. The blank door
seemed to deny him even that.</p>

<p>It was very dark in the high-walled garden, but a
ray from a side-window caught the Church Army
summer-house across the lawn, and sprang a text into
being. “Feed my sheep,” said the text, in reference
to scrambled teas dispensed by Helwise under the
Reckitt’s roof, but it brought many other things to
his mind, to-night. He stood still and looked at it,
thinking of the helpless stock the sea had taken.
Brack’s dead, woolly things would cry to him for
many a long day to come. He thought, too, of the
marshfolk, broken and spent to-day because of his
father’s building and his own seal upon it, of the two
at Ladyford sleeping their last sleep; and out of the
dark from over the west there seemed to come to him
an exceeding bitter cry: “Where is the flock that was
given thee, thy beautiful flock?”</p>

<p>As he turned again to the house, the door was flung
open, and Helwise peered into the night.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Armer? Whatever are you doing,
so late? I thought you had gone home long ago.
But as you <i>are</i> here, you may as well bring a pound of
bacon when you come in the morning, or there’ll be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
none for breakfast. Sliced. One pound. And remember
I will <i>not</i> have those brown boots blacked!”</p>

<p>Lanty stepped inside.</p>

<p>“It isn’t Armer,” he said.</p>

<p>Helwise jumped and stared. It was certainly not
Armer, but in that first instant it seemed to her as
if it was not Lanty, either. Her voice was almost
hushed.</p>

<p>“Why, Lancelot! When I saw you on the step,
I thought for a moment it was your father!”</p>

<p>“Thank God it is not!” he answered, and moved
towards his office. Across the hall, where the drawing-room
door stood slightly ajar, he could see that there
was a warm fire in the loathly grate, though the grate
itself he could not see, nor the pot dogs on the mantelpiece.
There was no light in the room but the light
of the fire. On a low stool Dandy was sitting, staring
into the red glow as it poured out and wrapped her
round, setting a thousand torches to the brightness
of her hair, and racing with golden feet over her
slender grace. She looked curiously lonely, he thought,
since there was somebody else in the room, whose voice
he placed without hesitation. If the somebody else
hadn’t been there, he might perhaps have entered,
drawn by the first real glimpse of heart’s joy the house
had held for years. At least he might have stood on
the threshold and looked within, before his personal
tragedy dragged him back into the desert; but instead
he turned to Helwise, still staring at him with that
half-look of fear.</p>

<p>“Can I have something to eat? I don’t seem to
have had anything all day—I don’t remember.”</p>

<p>At the sound of his voice Dandy sprang up, looking
nervously towards the hall, and Harriet came out of
the dusk and stood beside her. Helwise threw the
door wide.</p>

<p>“Don’t go into the office, Lancelot! There’s no
fire, and the gas has been escaping. What a dreadful
storm, wasn’t it? I felt certain every minute that the
house would be blown down. I don’t know why I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
didn’t have a heart-attack! Dandy and Harriet came
over for news, so I made them promise to stay until
you got back. I really <i>couldn’t</i> be left alone, and it’s
Our Agnes’s night out.”</p>

<p>The two girls came forward into the hall.</p>

<p>“It was very good of you,” Lanty said mechanically,
looking at them with tired eyes. Behind them he
could see the grate, now, and the pot dogs. Helwise
chattered on.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know if you can have anything
to eat! I expected you’d get some food at one of the
farms. You always say you like it best there. We’ve
had supper some time since, and it’s the girl’s night
out, as I said. There isn’t any meat in the house, I
know, and there won’t be any bacon for breakfast,
as you weren’t Armer, after all, but I dare say you
can have some tea, if you care about it. I put some
into the Thermos at five o’clock, thinking you might
turn up, so you can’t say I don’t remember your
comfort sometimes! I’ll go and get it.”</p>

<p>“Hot whisky do you a jolly sight more good!”
Harriet shot out bluntly, without looking at him.
She looked instead at the sign-manual of her bicycle
on the wall. Dandy, in an apologetic tone, murmured
“Soup!”</p>

<p>Lanty smiled faintly. What a mixture life was—bathos
dancing on the edge of the Pit! Now he came
to think of it, he did not want anything to eat. He
had asked for it as one asks for some small alleviation
in an unbearable trial. He would not have the
Thermos, anyhow.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter. I don’t really care anything
about it.” The smile was slightly satirical, this time.
“I’d forgotten it was Our Agnes’s night out!”</p>

<p>Helwise looked upset, and as if she might be getting
ready for another heart-attack.</p>

<p>“I dare say there’s a tin of something somewhere,
but I shouldn’t know what to do with it if there was.
You’d much better let me get the Therm.—<i>not</i> in the
office, Lancelot! I meant to have had it all tidied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
up before you got back, but Dandy brought another
crochet pattern and that was how I didn’t turn off
the gas. What I mean is that I’ve been hunting
through your old papers for accounts of the Lugg when
it was first built. I thought it would be so interesting
to have them pasted in a book now that the thing’s
gone altogether, and then there’ll be all the fresh
paragraphs about it, this week. I felt sure you would
like to see them, but there were so many years back
to look through, and the stickphast stuck such lots
of other things beside the right ones. Oh, and do you
know, Lancelot, there was a photograph of your
father taken on the top of the Lugg, with his foot on
the last spadeful, and on the right—no, left!—that
poor old Whinnerah person who was drowned? Underneath
they’d put: ‘Conqueror of the Sea!’ Don’t
you think that it would be nice to have the photograph
reproduced in this week’s paper, while everybody is so
interested? People forget so soon. There might be
a companion one of you, too, don’t you think, looking
at one of the breaks?”</p>

<p>“With my foot on a coffin?” Lanty’s voice, risen
a little, had in it something strange and wild. He
stood gazing at her with a fixed expression on his
face, striving to measure the exact immensity of the
gulf between them, seeing her thousand selfish follies
climb out of it like mocking gnomes. He had done
all he could for her, not all she wanted, perhaps, but
everything within his power, and at his greatest need
she gave him nothing—no, much worse than nothing—in
return. In this his hour of bitterness she would
drag his dead into light, holding it up to public calumny
with a pot of stickphast. He closed the office door
between them, and heard her burst into terrified tears
on the other side.</p>

<p>“It was his father!” she sobbed and gasped, as
the girls attempted to soothe her. “It’s no use telling
me it was Lancelot, because he never looked at me like
that in his life. They say the dead come back sometimes,
and stare at you through the children’s eyes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
and I’m sure it’s true! He never liked me—the other.
He always said I was silly, and I was frightened of
him. I believe Lancelot is drowned, and this is his
father come back in his place! No, it’s no use talking
to me about eggs and bread-and-butter! If he’s a
ghost, how can he eat? I won’t stay down here—no,
I daren’t! He might come out again, and I should
never get over it!”</p>

<p>She tore herself out of their hands, and stumbled,
panting and weeping, up the stairs, and immediately
they heard the bolt of her door shoot home. They
were left in the hall, looking at each other, awkward
and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“This is rot!” Harriet observed presently.
“Helwise must have gone clean off it. We can’t
let the man starve. We’d better see if we can’t dig
up something. That soup-notion of yours was first-class.”</p>

<p>“We might try,” Dandy agreed, “but I’m afraid I
know next to nothing about cooking.”</p>

<p>“Well, <i>I</i> know everything!” Harriet answered
calmly. “I can make soup that will fetch you galloping
from the top of the house. You good-looking
people haven’t bagged quite <i>all</i> the tricks in this unjust
world!”</p>

<p>They went exploring into the dark larder, and both
the rich man’s daughter and the mistress of the spotless
farm-house exclaimed at the patent evidences of
neglect.</p>

<p>“No bread!” Harriet commented, leaning over the
big pot with a guttering dip. “Wish I’d left that last
tough old crust at supper. Weren’t there some
biscuits in that sixpence-ha’penny glass thing in the
dining-room? Just think on about them, will you?
Half a blanc-mange and a few pine-apple chunks—<i>that’s</i>
no use to a hungry man! It’s all he’ll get for
breakfast, though, by the look of things. I wonder
if it’s any good going down into the cellar? Helwise
said there was no meat, didn’t she? Eggs? No, I’m
afraid not! There <i>must</i> be some milk, though—I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
wonder where? Might be in the boot-cupboard, on
<i>this</i> system. Come on! We’ve got to unearth that
soup somehow!”</p>

<p>They found the full tin stowed thoughtfully among
a stack of empty ones, and in the dirty kitchen Harriet
began her labours by the light of a gas-jet that burnt
one-sidedly with a shrieking flame. Fortunately for
present conditions, though not for the master’s pocket,
the fire had been left piled up high; but this piece of
criminal wastefulness was the only happy accident
that befell them.</p>

<p>“What beats <i>me</i>,” Harriet remarked, sniffing disgustedly
at pans, and flinging half-washed spoons into
a slimy tin in a stopped-up sink, “is why Lanty hasn’t
been poisoned before now, or at any rate sold up and
carted to the Workhouse. It’s too bad of old Helwise,
it really is! After all, he keeps her, and he works
jolly hard. She might have done him a bit better
than this. Do you mind cleaning a few of these things
while I open the soup?”</p>

<p>So while Harriet boiled, Dandy scrubbed, and produced,
by some conjuror’s wand, a bowl and silver
spoon, a small tray and a passably clean tray-cloth;
also the biscuits. When the soup was added, steaming
and strong, they looked at each other with conscious
pride, on the heels of which came a sudden sense of
guilt and confusion. After all, it was open to question
that a couple of outsiders should be cooking food for
a man in his own kitchen without his permission or
even his knowledge.</p>

<p>“How are you going back?” Harriet asked, covering
in the range, and slipping a plate over the lidless bowl.
“I meant to have cleared out long before this. I
hope Stubbs hasn’t been worrying Cyril.”</p>

<p>The name came out naturally enough, but Dandy
started a little. The use of it by Harriet seemed to
put her old friend Wiggie in a new light.</p>

<p>“Father is coming for me,” she replied. “He had
to go to Manchester to-day, but he said he’d run over
as soon as he got back. He wanted to see Mr. Lancaster.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
You’ll wait and come with us, won’t you? He
should be here any time now, and I can’t stop alone,
with my hostess locked away upstairs.”</p>

<p>“Right you are!” Harriet lifted the tray with
reverent care. “Put out that one-eyed gas, will you,
and light the candle? There’s a cockroach crawling
up you—don’t know if you’re keen on ’em! You’d
better go on in front and yell out if there are any
booby-traps. I nearly broke my shin over a clothes-horse,
and we can’t afford to lose the soup.”</p>

<p>But in the hall she stopped, even as her hand was
raised to knock, for Dandy, with flushed cheeks, had
stepped back into the firelight from the drawing-room,
bringing to the other how Lanty had paused—from her
corner she had seen him—paused, weary as he was,
to look at the same picture. There had been in his
face something of which he had not known, but which
even Harriet, unobservant and callous, had not failed
to read. It was as if, in that instant, he had seen at
last the “silly home” of his desire.</p>

<p>She drew back, holding out the tray.</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> take it in, will you? I’m not fit to be seen,
after grubbing about in that region of the lost.”</p>

<p>Dandy started, and shook her head violently.</p>

<p>“Nonsense! It’s <i>your</i> cooking. Go in and collect
your own credit. If it comes to that, <i>I’m</i> not fit to be
seen, either!”</p>

<p>“Don’t fish!” Harriet snarled. “Buck up, I tell
you! The stuff’s freezing. I’m not going in, anyway,
so if you won’t take it I may as well sling it through
the window.”</p>

<p>“But——” Dandy advanced with reluctance. “I
don’t like to! It’s your place. You know him so
much better than I.”</p>

<p>“That’s just it. He doesn’t want the folks he knows.
They know too much. I’d probably be giving him my
opinion before he asked it. You walk in as if you were
used to it, and he’ll probably think you’re only Our
Agnes.”</p>

<p>Dandy took the tray slowly, still doubtful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>“Git!” said Harriet, and knocked. Without waiting
for an answer, she opened the door and pushed the
girl in, closing it again instantly. Not content with
that, she went out into the porch, and shut the inner
door behind her. She would not even be within reach
of their voices. The damp cold swept in from the
west as she stood in the dark, biting her lip. The
standard of action is mercifully adjusted to each of
us, and perhaps Harriet’s funny, homely, big-little
sacrifice formed a fine enough leaf in the laurels of
Love.</p>

<p>She had been there barely a couple of minutes
before the Watters limousine turned in and drew
up at the step. She went forward, expecting to see
Hamer, but instead, out of it came Wiggie. He
came carefully, with the chauffeur’s hand under his
arm, a wavering shadow uncertain of its feet, but
yet he came, smiling a ghost of his old smile at Harriet’s
amazement and concern. The chauffeur planted him
safely within reach of her assistance, and returned to
his car.</p>

<p>“Hamer’s a little way behind,” the new-comer
explained breathlessly. “We met a certain Mr.
Dennison going home from Bluecaster, and Hamer
wanted to ask him things, so I came on.”</p>

<p>“But what on earth are you doing here at all?”
Harriet demanded angrily. “What were Stubbs and
that cap-and-apron nurse thinking of? Go back at
once, or you’ll die!”</p>

<p>Wiggie looked guilty, trying to lean against a
flower-stand afflicted with a chronic wobble, and she
put her hand beneath his elbow.</p>

<p>“Oh, I needn’t die yet, need I, please? Hamer
came round on his way here, and I—he seemed lonely.
Dennison said Lancaster was back.”</p>

<p>Harriet nodded, opening the glass door, and supporting
him inside.</p>

<p>“You’d better come out of the cold, as you <i>are</i>
here. Yes. About an hour since. Looking about
twenty years older, and half-cracked. Sent Helwise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
upstairs in screaming hysterics. He’s in there.” She
jerked her head towards the office. “Dandy’s with
him.”</p>

<p>Wiggie gave one long, quiet glance at the closed
door. No sound of voices came to the two equally
silent outside, the absence of speech within that shut
room conveying an intimate isolation that no exchange
of words could have held. In that look it seemed
almost as if he were saying good-bye. Then he turned
to Harriet, smiling as on the step.</p>

<p>“I did not come for Dandy,” he said gently. “I
came for you.”</p>

<p>Harriet blushed violently. She looked angered
almost to tears.</p>

<p>“You’ve no need to lie to <i>me</i>, Cyril! I should have
thought you ought to know that, by now.”</p>

<p>“But it is true!” he said simply. And it <i>was</i> true.
The look had been merely the seal set on a renunciation
made weeks ago on the Watters stairs. “It’s
been such a dreadfully long day without you! Dear
old Stubbs has been hunting germs, and the nurse
told me all the diseases I’d just missed having, and
all the diseases I might have yet, if I’d hurry up.
Can’t we slip away now, and send the car back for the
others? Hamer won’t mind.”</p>

<p>“But don’t you want to see Lanty?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I’d better not worry him to-night. I’ll
be ready for him when he wants me, poor old man!
Please take me home.” His voice was very weak, and
she felt him heavy on her arm. “You might, you
know. You’re not the only lonely pebble on the
beach!”</p>

<p>Harriet blushed again, but without anger, this time.
Wiggie had known, all along, and the thought had never
hurt her or made her ashamed. And no matter where
his own love was placed, he yet had an urgent need
of herself. She remembered how he had turned to
Wild Duck as his refuge. It was queerly pleasant to
be needed. She would take him home.</p>

<p>They got him back to the car with some difficulty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
and, once inside, he lay against the cushions so still
that she was afraid, until she found that he had simply
fallen into exhausted sleep. He had spent all his little
store of strength in coming to her in the dark hour
when she had deliberately shut herself out of Heaven.
It was strange that he should always be digging her
out of deep places. It seemed almost like fate.</p>

<p>The Rur’l D’trict C’cillor drew the rug more closely
round him with an oddly-motherly touch.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There was indeed a vile smell of gas in the office,
and an unlighted fire, astonishingly badly laid, showed
yesterday’s cinders still unraked. A perfect sea of
newspapers heaved along the floor, and across them
Lanty’s boots had trodden a path to his desk at the
far end, where his private documents had been swept
aside to make room for more <i>Gazettes</i>. A large island
of stickphast sat smugly upon the fine leather. The
shelves had been ruthlessly rifled. Cupboard doors
stood open. The newspapers themselves, evidently
long folded away with neat precision, had been crushed
and crumpled, slashed or torn across. For a second,
Dandy forgot her nervousness in sheer amazed horror.</p>

<p>Lanty was standing by the desk, with one of the
myriad sheets in his hand, looking down at it with a
still intentness and absorption. When he heard the
door he lifted his head without turning, clutching the
paper close as if afraid that somebody might see it
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” he asked, still with the air of being
on guard, and Dandy of the Tray, in a faint and rather
frightened voice, wishing herself safely back at Watters
answered: “Our Agnes!” The silver spoon clinked
against the bowl.</p>

<p>Lanty had been well-trained by weekly nightmare
meals to the stern remembrance of the “girl’s night
out,” but in the present stress of circumstance his
weary brain had again let slip the important fact.
The voice might easily have belonged to Our Agnes,
who boasted an organ varying between the colourless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
twitter of a new-fledged sparrow and the discordance
of the tom-tom. It certainly carried no faintest
reminder of Dandy. Moreover, in his passionate
concentration upon the paper, yielding to it entire
heart and soul and quickened, yearning memory,
Dandy was as if she had never been.</p>

<p>He did not turn, because he was afraid to let even a
vacant mirror like Our Agnes reflect his face; and also
for another reason. The fragrance of Harriet’s galloping
soup reached him quickly across the room, waking
him to the violent realisation that he had not tasted
food for many hours. If he saw it, he might be
driven to a fierce snatching which would send Our
Agnes to join Helwise in her orgy of hysterics upstairs;
so he stood fast, clasping the paper like a child in
peril.</p>

<p>“Will you put it down—whatever it is?” The tray
touched the table. “Thanks! And, while you’re
here, do you mind lighting the fire? I couldn’t find
any matches.”</p>

<p>He sat down in the desk-chair, struggling with his
consuming hunger, and cursing himself for having
kept her a moment longer than was necessary. She
would take hours to light the fire—she always did—and
he would have to sit in torture until she had
finished. But he was very cold, chill with hunger as
well as damp, and the mere consciousness of a woman’s
presence had roused the weary man’s instinctive claim
for help. Perhaps she would not find the matches,
either, and while she went for others he could retreat
in dignity with the food. But she did find them. He
heard them rattle as she drew them out from behind
the clock. Why on earth hadn’t he thought of looking
there himself? It wasn’t like Our Agnes to be so
quickwitted. Now he would have to sit through an
eternity of craving while she fumbled with the wet
sticks. He fixed his eyes furtively on the paper, and
was back again sharply in his former atmosphere of
longing and regret.</p>

<p>Dandy, on her knees, fighting the unwilling sticks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
fought also the strangling tears and pitiful laughter in
her own heart. Harriet’s jest was become fact; he had
indeed taken her for Our Agnes! Her voice had
sounded strange even in her own ears—she admitted
that; but, if she had ever had a real place in his life,
ever stirred, if only for an instant, his difficult heart,
ever been to him even a fraction of more worth than
the slattern in his kitchen, would he not have known
that there was somebody quite other in the room?
She looked at his tired back and roughened hair with
a great rush of pity and pain and longing to help,
but it did not reach him. His wet wristbands and
soaked boots blurred before her misty eyes, but he
did not guess or care. Love was round him, kissing
his hand, begging at his knee, pressing his aching
head to rest, but he could not feel it. She might
have drawn his attention with a word, a touch, but
she left the one unspoken, the other unperformed.
There are rights belonging to unself-conscious friendship
that shrinking, fastidious love will never claim.</p>

<p>How could he <i>not</i> know? Ah, but he <i>ought</i> to have
known! If he had cared ever so little, he would have
guessed at her presence; cared much—sprung to meet
it; and, last of all, if he had loved her, he would have
looked for her to come to him somehow from the very
ends of the earth.</p>

<p>But he had done none of these things. There was
no answer to her prayer. If he never guessed, never
turned, she would know that she meant nothing to
him at all.</p>

<p>The soup was getting cold. She fretted, battling
with the fire. Harriet would be annoyed if their
labour was wasted, and he seemed too deep in his
reading to remember that she had brought him food.
Nervously she pushed the basin up the table within
reach of his hand, and went back to her task. When
she looked round again, it was empty, and he had
buried himself afresh in his paper. After the thrill
of joy that she had at least given him some shred of
comfort came the renewed certainty that he was quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
unconscious of the giver. It was more than plain
that she was outside his thoughts altogether.</p>

<p>The fire was crackling merrily now, and with a last
strained hope that he might yet know her, she began
to gather the papers into a corner, but before she had
set the last on the pile, she saw him stir as if distressed
and irritated through his absorption by her quiet
movements. She stopped instantly, then, and moved
to the door, yet slowly, and looking towards him, and
all the way her heart was begging, begging for a sign.
She knew that all these months her little taper of hope
had burnt bravely, bending at times to the wind of
disappointment, but always brightening and glowing.
Now it was dying. By the time she reached the door
it would be dead. Yet she would not call, nor speak
aloud the words that the soul only could utter and its
twin-soul only should hear. Even a commonplace
he might possibly resent in this his trouble. He had
said she did not understand. He might certainly say
it now, if, in her ignorance of the real conditions, she
tried to comfort him. She could only speak to him
dumbly from her heart, and he did not hear. His
home, his resting-place, were at hand, and he held
his face from them. The little torch flickered low.
The handle turned, and turned again. Outside the
door Dandy stood, hugging her dead candle.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Hamer came in like an anxious bear in his large
coat, and found her there.</p>

<p>“All alone?” he asked, stooping to kiss her.
“Where’s the boy?”</p>

<p>“In the office. Miss Lancaster is upstairs. She
seems rather upset.”</p>

<p>“That so? Poor little woman! I’ll go up and
have a look at her. She wants stroking a bit, I
reckon. Can you wait any longer, little girl, or are
you aching to get home? I’d like just to have a word
with the boy, if he’ll see me.”</p>

<p>“Yes—do. I don’t mind how long I wait.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get Miss Lancaster down to keep you company.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
He stopped, his foot on the first stair, lowering his
voice. “Does the boy look bad, Dandy Anne?”</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>“I doubt he’ll take it terribly hard—worse than
anybody else would have done. He didn’t say anything
to you, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“No. Nothing.” (And, verily—nothing!)</p>

<p>“You look a bit white, dearie. Getting tired, are
you?” He came back to her. “Didn’t <i>you</i> say a
word to him, Dandy Anne? Didn’t you try to comfort
the poor lad?”</p>

<p>She smiled bravely.</p>

<p>“I took him some soup, Daddy! Harriet made it,
and I ‘dished up.’ I don’t think he wanted to talk.
He’s very tired.”</p>

<p>Hamer said no more, looking down at her anxiously,
trying to read her face. Sorrow was for bringing folks
together, said Hamer’s simple philosophy, but it
seemed to have failed here. He couldn’t think of
any trouble in which his first longing would not be
to feel Dandy’s arms round his neck. Things were
wrong somewhere for his little girl. Had he brought
her to Watters only to seek diligently for pain?</p>

<p>“Please hurry a little bit, Daddy dear!”</p>

<p>He gave her a last glance, turning reluctantly, with
words evidently trembling on his lips; then marched
off up the stair. Above, she could hear him pounding
at Helwise’s door, and presently he had her out on the
landing.</p>

<p>“It was his father!” Helwise chattered still.</p>

<p>“Nonsense, my dear! You’re a bit overstrung,
that’s what it is! You want somebody to pet you and
tuck you up on the sofa with a hot bottle—that’s it,
isn’t it? Now you put your hand through my arm
and we’ll trot along down to the fire. Why, you’re
just shivering, poor dear! I’ve got a plan to propose
to you, if you’ll take it on. What do you say to
sending Lancaster for a trip after he’s got things in
working order again—say Egypt or the Canaries—and
you shut up house and come over to Watters?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
If we get a fairish spring we might try a motor-tour
after Easter—how’d you like that? Cathedral cities,
perhaps, or something of that sort. You keep Dandy
company for a bit while I look in at the boy, and see
if she can’t persuade you to think it over!”</p>

<p>So Helwise, purring with excitement, was stayed with
cushions and comforted with cathedrals in front of
the drawing-room fire, and Dandy, very heart-sick and
resentful at her selfish neglect, yet remembered that
she was something of Lanty’s, and was patient and
sweet with her therefore, mapping out a tour on the
hearthrug, with the whole of her being reaching
across the hall.</p>

<p>Hamer knocked once, and went straight in to the
lonely figure without a moment’s hesitation, setting
big, raising hands on its shoulders. The Hamers of
the world may do these things with impunity, for in
their rare, angelic sincerity they carry an Open Sesame
through the locked gates of the furthest shrinking
sorrow. And though a dreaded somebody was looking
over his shoulder at last, Lanty let his paper lie, and
neither moved nor minded. Hamer’s eye passed over
it as he drew up a chair and sat down close.</p>

<p>“I had to go to Manchester. Only just home, or
I’d have been down—<i>there</i>—with you. I was somewhere
on the marsh, as it was, until after three. Had
anything to eat?”</p>

<p>“Yes, thanks.” Lanty’s voice sounded as if pulled
by a string. “I’m afraid I frightened Helwise a little,
but the girl brought me some soup. She lighted the
fire, too. She’s not usually so useful.”</p>

<p>Hamer stared a minute, but said nothing. What
game had Dandy been playing? Had Lanty really
mistaken her for the “girl”?</p>

<p>“Miss Lancaster’s all right now, anyhow. She
and Dandy Anne are having a cosy chat in the drawing-room,
snug as snug. She’s very easy thrown out of
gear. Dandy’s cosseting her a bit.”</p>

<p>“It’s very kind of Miss Shaw.” Hamer glanced at
him shrewdly, but found the answer purely mechanical.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
No; this wasn’t Dandy’s hour, he decided with a
sigh.</p>

<p>“I heard the—bad news—before I left. Lancaster,
I can’t forgive myself for having that show of mine,
last night!”</p>

<p>“It made very little difference.”</p>

<p>“A deal, surely! There’d have been many more,
sheep saved, if the men had been on the spot.”</p>

<p>“I doubt it. You forget that they didn’t think the
storm anything out of the common.”</p>

<p>“Except Brack. It was queer how he knew, wasn’t
it? I’m blessed if I can make it out! He certainly
did his best to warn us.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. But Brack’s was hardly a business
proposition.”</p>

<p>His tone was cold, and Hamer felt suddenly silenced.
He raised his eyes to the portrait above them, vivid
with energy and pride, remembering Helwise’s hysterical
conviction, and the likeness between father and son,
always marked, struck him strangely to-night. Reversion
to type is always the first strong instinct to emerge
under great stress. There had been something much
deeper than she knew behind Miss Lancaster’s chattered
fears.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll fix no more hotpots till I get the weather
ruled to order!” Hamer sighed. “I suppose the
Lugg’s broken its back out and out? I saw a paper
in Manchester. Those poor old souls at the Pride!
I met Dennison, just now. He said Whinnerah was
set on going there. You’d no choice but to let him
have it, had you?”</p>

<p>Lanty thought a moment. There <i>had</i> been choice,
perhaps, at the very beginning. He hardly knew; so
swift had the hour of forced decision come upon him.</p>

<p>“They made it the test of my belief in the Lugg,”
he said. “If the storm were to-morrow instead of
yesterday, I would still let the cottage to-night!”</p>

<p>“Then you think you were right about the bank?
You don’t blame it—you still think it justified?”
Hamer stammered, taken aback.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>For the first time Lanty turned and looked him
straight in the eyes.</p>

<p>“Shaw, I’ve <i>got</i> to think it! If I didn’t, I should
shoot myself. I’ve <i>got</i> to believe, in spite of everything,
that the thing had a right to its existence. I’m
not of the class that judge their fathers. I was brought
up to see mine as the standing emblem of right thinking
and right doing, and though out on the marsh I lost
my bearings awhile and forgot it, I found my faith
again here. This was his house, his office, his desk.
There’s his face above it. Even now the place seems
almost more his than mine, and, sitting here, I know
what he saw, feel what he felt.” He laid his hand on
the paper. “This is the full account of the building
of the Lugg—how it was opposed and condemned, and
finally sanctioned, fully sanctioned by expert authority—yes,
and praised and copied! My father <i>had</i> the
right to take the risk, both for himself and for posterity.
That’s the faith I lost—and regained. The success was
his. The rest—the failure—is mine.”</p>

<p>Hamer shook his head.</p>

<p>“The world won’t agree with you, my boy! It will
say you had no chance, that you were bound to stand
by your father’s work. It will place the fault with
the man before you.”</p>

<p>“It will be wrong! It isn’t that I don’t believe in
inheritance, in reaping and sowing from one generation
to another. I’ve seen the dragon’s teeth come up too
often for that. We’re bound both before and behind—I
admit it all the way. Thinking of a race, from
father to son, I always see—what is it?—‘the lean,
locked ranks go roaring down to die.’ We’ve a hand
in more fates than one. But, in spite of that, I hold
that a strong man wins out on his own—wins out, or
goes to the wall. There’s no other self-respecting
creed. This thing fell to me. Judgment is due on
me. I wouldn’t have it otherwise. Each of us in
his little day represents all the rest, and in his own
person stands by what he reaps. I say, I wouldn’t
have it otherwise!” And he said to the father as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
had said to the daughter in an hour of sympathy
forgot. “It’s our job while we’re on to it. It’s our
job while the light lasts, to make the best of it we
can. It’s always one man’s hand on the lonely
plough.”</p>

<p>After the long silence, Hamer rose.</p>

<p>“I must be getting back to my little girl. Promise
me you’ll be off to bed soon, and not stop the night
here, fretting and thinking. And for Heaven’s sake
get out of those sopping clothes! No—don’t come
with me. Dandy’ll understand. Cyril came over for
a word with you—did you know?—but he thought
he’d better not bother you to-night. And Mother sent
her love. Save us! I’d have caught it if I’d forgotten
that! You’ll look us up, sometime?”</p>

<p>“When I’ve made my world over again.”</p>

<p>“Lancaster”—the words came hesitatingly, almost
as if the speaker wondered at himself and them—“there’s
one thing I envy you, anyway! I’m just
a plain business-man who’s never run up against much
except money that everybody else doesn’t taste equal,
but you and your father between you have had something
bigger and grander than comes to most folk,
something that sets you near alongside the gods. They
say old Whinnerah stuck it out because of you both,
though Brack went to fetch him. For how many of
us others, I wonder, would a man die to prove our
pledged word?”</p>

<p>Before he went upstairs, Lanty opened the door and
called to Helwise, still purring over her prospects.
She rose startled, and came fearfully. He was standing
by the table, and upon it the <i>Gazette</i> lay wide.
The whole world might see it now.</p>

<p>“I hope you haven’t waited up for me,” he said,
quite gently. “I just wanted to tell you that I
should like those cuttings in a book, after all. I
should be grateful if you would finish them for me.”</p>

<p>The tears rushed back to her eyes.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to vex you. I didn’t mean to be
prying and unkind! I thought all the fine things they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
said about the Lugg might comfort you a little—help
you——”</p>

<p>“They have helped me.”</p>

<p>“Of course I know you’ll blame yourself because
those two old people got themselves drowned, and the
sheep and the mangolds and everything like that, but
everybody thought it was very wonderful when it was
built, and admired your father and said he had such a
good leg! He was ever so proud of that photograph
when it came out.”</p>

<p>“I am proud of it, too,” Lanty said, leaning over
the paper. He looked long from his father’s face to
that of Wolf behind. It was hard to think that both
were dead—men of a personality that never really dies,
but lives on in its effects. Taking a pen, he added a
letter to the inscription below, and left the paper
lying—</p>

<p class="center">“CONQUEROR<span class="sans"><i>S</i></span> OF THE SEA.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII<br>

<small>THE GREEN GATES OF VISION:—VI. SWEETHEART-TIME</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the late October afternoon Lancaster rode
through the Lane fast, for he was behind time with
his promise. Therefore he looked ahead of him to
each flying curve, letting the Gates of Vision pass
without notice, nor culling one magic thrill from the
garden of enchantment. Yet he checked suddenly
where the Lane ran off at right angles like a darting
trout, half lest his pressed horse should take the hedge,
half in joyful recognition. Out on the drifting distance—of
the land, yet of the sky also—his Ghost-Mountain
smote his eye with its strange twin-qualities of edged
clarity and floating opaqueness, like the Shoulder of
God made manifest, yet not clothed upon with flesh.
What help had it for him, after all these desolate
months?</p>

<p>He could spare it only a moment’s greeting, but for
some reason his heart was lighter as he rode on. Amid
the wreck of much the Ghost-Mountain had foundered
too, forgotten. Its vivid, unexpected return set a
faint hope beating that somehow, through some outside
power, other lost things might come to resurrection
also.</p>

<p>The spell of the “back-end” had its will again,
and in spite of him caught him in its wound gossamer
of remembrance. Though he looked between his
horse’s ears, he knew well enough that round him on
every hand were soft distances, melting, blending and
changing from blue to purple and purple to gray, with
filmy pillars of smoke raised like the standards of
home against the stark, stripped woods. He could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
not keep his cheek from the mild fingers of the gentle
air, nor from his lungs the smell of the fresh, damp
earth, going rain- and dew-washed to its winter sleep.
And under the horse’s hoofs the dry leaves rustled and
the wet leaves crushed into a still, soft carpet of
stamped crimson and bruised gold. Far in the amber
sky a black little bird was singing, swung on a twig
like a poised finger, and over Dick Crag he could hear
the baffling music of tired hounds on the last spurt of
the afternoon. Little by little he was taken and held
by the old wonder and the familiar glory, so that the
last terrible months dropped away, and his heavily
self-raised prison unlocked. Through the cruel summer
he had come mechanically and doggedly, with all his
joy in his work gone like a blown petal, together with
the quivering sympathy that had made him the
perfect instrument of atmosphere and environment.
For this is the last punishment of souls ordinarily
attuned to Nature, when bent to the yoke of pain or
sin. They cry to her, and she does not answer; she
calls to them, and they do not heed; for though the
eyes look abroad on the same beauty, the ears gather
the same music, the spirit and meaning are fled, leaving
only soulless mirages and jangled wires. But to-night
Lancaster came back again to his kingdom.</p>

<p>The look of sudden age, stamped on that far death-dawn,
still clung to some extent; the stern lines of
his face were hammered and set; he was thinner, and
his hair had whitened a little. But for compensation
he had a new self-reliance, a new quietude born of the
absence of nervous struggle. His was now the unfearful
poise of one who has fallen and risen again
before the hammer of the gods.</p>

<p>The inquest, the long, dreary spell of wild weather,
intensifying the merciless handling of the marsh—the
dismal rent-audit, the interminable hours of calculating
and planning, of patient hearing of complaint, of
ordering and overseeing repairs—all these were
behind him now. The new tenant was settled at
Ninekyrkes, and the Dockerays had taken both him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
and his to their robbed hearts. For Francey was in
Canada with Lup, and though the old folk were for
ever planning a future that held Rowly with a wife at
Ladyford, and Lup back at the twin-farm—Dockera’s
and Whinnerahs as of yore—they knew well enough
that for the wanderers there could be no place ever
again on the Northern marsh.</p>

<p>Slowly the wreck of things was pulled back into
symmetry and order—houses carpeted and papered,
Dutch barns rebuilt, fences set up again, the mutilated
roads laid and rolled. The Let, too, had had all its
yawning mouths filled and strengthened, and the
dykes and cuts were deepened and increased. So the
patched marsh grew trim again, and by the time the
haycutter sang on the hill, the land below had gathered
itself out of the horrors of destruction into a growing
likeness of its old beauty. Only the Lugg and the
Pride were left untouched, derelicts at the will of wind
and tide.</p>

<p>The story had roused a storm of interest throughout
the country, coming as it did at a slack time for news,
and carrying with it the precious breath of long
romance. Lanty refused all dealings with reporters
and kept his eyes from the papers, yet knew well
enough that both his father’s career and his own,
their private life, and probably his personal future,
were all common property in a highly decorated
fashion. Into a seething world of clashing interests
and warring classes the tale of the Northern property,
where the flower of ancestry still sprang purely as
well from yeoman and peasant stock as from patrician,
where law was less than loyalty, long service a matter
of course, friendship and understanding things born
of inbred knowledge—dropped like a mediæval,
blazoned shield into the arena of modern warfare.
Men picked it up wonderingly, fitting it clumsily to
an unaccustomed arm, only to discard it with a laugh.</p>

<p>“No agreements? <i>That’s</i> a lie, anyhow! You’ve
got to have everything down in writing, nowadays,
or else it’s just simply putting your neck in a halter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
Landlord’s personal charm—tenants’ appreciation—sounds
like the days of Magna Charta, doesn’t it?—tenure
by knight service, socage, villeinage, and all the
rest of it! I must say these journalists know how
to pile on the colour. Amity between agent and
farmers—well, I just <i>don’t</i> think! Why, it’s an understood
thing that they’re always at each other’s throats!
Scion of Hugh Lupus of the Conquest gives his life
for an old trust—feudalism dug up by the spadeful,
and plastered on with a trowel! <i>Lies!</i>”</p>

<p>Yet the true picture was there all the time, defying
the brush of maudlin sentiment, as a masterpiece
glimmers through a daub.</p>

<p>The rights of the case spun between blame and
praise like a feather between two mouths. Both
Lancasters were strong men of a rare type that should
be stuffed and labelled. They were also murderers,
and should both have been drowned; truth-lovers,
peace-rulers, regarding their charge as sacred; specious
liars and hypocrites, afflicted with a grossly inordinate
ambition.</p>

<p>But, as a matter of fact, there was plenty of sympathy
for the son, the supposed victim of forced loyalty to a
weak employer and an arrogant parent, the creature
of destiny, bound to take the course he did, a helpless,
doomed sheep, like all the other martyrs of the marsh.
There were certain well-meaning souls who pursued
Lanty with such comforting extracts, but even these
smug blunderers did not do it twice. Only Lup and
Francey, over the sea, and Hamer, sadly silent, knew
what he really felt about it all; and not they fully.
There are debts a man pays in himself alone.</p>

<p>He had resisted all attempts to get him away—Hamer’s
pleasant plan for the Canaries had had a
short existence and a sudden and violent death—but
Helwise had not been defrauded of her tour. For a
month she had spun luxuriously from place to place,
petted and considered, chattering incessantly and
happy as a singing kettle. And after that they had
kept her at Watters for long enough, while Blenkinship’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
Marget, lent to Lanty during his aunt’s absence,
scrubbed and organised like an inspired fury, ruthlessly
forcing the twittering Agnes through the mill of
discipline and method, and feeding the silent master
as he had hitherto been fed only in dreams. The
transfer had been brought about by Dandy, cognisant,
through bitter experience, of his need. But now
Helwise was coming home, and King Muddle would
have his own again.</p>

<p>Wigmore, slowly returning to a semblance of health,
had spent the summer recruiting at Bournemouth and
yachting with Bluecaster, and was now at Watters,
while over at Wild Duck Harriet entertained the
whole Quetta family (whose real name was something
quite different) with reckless generosity. Lanty had
seen her with them at the various Shows, preaching
Westmorland agriculture into puzzled foreign ears.
He had also seen Stubbs, no longer requiring to be
soothed with rotifers, hung about with Quetta-lings
like a family elephant.</p>

<p>But of Dandy he had seen nothing—nothing, that is,
but, at intervals, a smiling, daintily-gracious transparency
hovering on the borders of his clouded
existence. Blotted out in a night of storm, she, who
had come so near to meaning everything in his life,
had ceased to mean anything at all. But to-night the
old transfiguration was upon the once-loved fields,
and everything was human and dear again, even as
the friendly earth. At eventide there was light.</p>

<p>To a groom crossing the drive at Watters he handed
over his horse, and went up through the gate at the
top of the garden to the fields above. The house
behind him lay silent and apparently deserted, but in
Hamer’s meadow there was a busy little community,
receiving that particular instruction in butter-making
which comes under the County Council heading of
“Higher Education.”</p>

<p>The Travelling Dairy Van from Asprigg was planted
on the breast of the hill looking over the tiny, half-hidden
village below, the long curve of the North Road,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
and the upward sweep of the park. In the big tent
stretching from the side of the Van a dozen churns
were at work on the wet boards of the temporary floor,
and in the frame of lifted curtains on the far side the
white gowns of pupils and instructress showed vividly
against the green of the hill beyond. There was quite
a little crowd on the surrounding benches, for this was
examination-day, and relatives and friends were present
to support the last supreme effort. On the raised
platform of the Van, Mr. and Mrs. Shaw, together with
Helwise and a county lady or two, backgrounded by a
couple of husbands, an odd parson and Grumphy,
surveyed the final throes of competition. The
examiner, moving about among the workers, was
very busy being taught his business by Harriet,
mightily full of contempt for all Dairy Schools and
officials thereto attached. In the last little gleam of
sun outside Wiggie was walking slowly with his brother,
while a gentle, foreign-looking woman struggled with
a trio of joyous ruffians rolling down the hill. Stubbs
had a fourth in the Rakestraw bath-chair, and was
wheeling it patiently if awkwardly over the steep
slope. The fourth was a sad little boy of eight, with
black eyes swallowing up a pathetic face, conducting
the bath-chair progression with the solemnity of high
ceremonial. He smiled once, though, when a rapturous
thrush, enamoured of the growing sunset, flung it a
little flutter of song from a near hedge; and Lanty
suddenly saw Wiggie in the smile.</p>

<p>From the middle of the tent, where the scales
awaited the butter, the caretaker ruled teacher and
taught alike, by virtue of ancient standing, peculiar
wit, and a deficiency in hearing which made mutual
wordy warfare impossible. To this autocrat Lanty
handed his onlooker’s threepence, stopping to exchange
a word with the examiner before joining Hamer on
the platform. Harriet, however, was still saying her
say.</p>

<p>“Of course I know you think you’re doing no end
of good, but it’s all rot! None of that butter will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
<i>really</i> fit to eat—you know it as well as I do. You
wash and work all the goodness out of it, for one
thing. Yet, in a minute, you and all the rest of the
crowd will get up and say what first-class stuff it is, just
because it looks pretty squatting on that table with a
silly pattern sprawling over it. You’ve admitted yourself
that I sent you in the best cream of all the farmers
round. Very well! I can send you in a sample of the
best butter to match. But I didn’t learn how to make
it in a rotten tent from a mass of theories walking about
with a notebook. I learned it from hard experience and
Stubbs’s swears when he had to eat the result. Butter-making
on the stage, <i>I</i> call it!” Harriet finished, glaring
round at the trim, white figures. “Might be a Gaiety
chorus getting ready to sing ‘We are the Churniest
Churners!’ or, ‘Never forget your Plug!’ Let ’em
go home and learn the real thing from their mothers!”</p>

<p>Wiggie looked in over the heads of the pleased
crowd.</p>

<p>“Harriet, I’d be awfully obliged if you could persuade
Geronimo to come out of the duck-pond! And
I rather believe that Stubbs has emptied the Little
Great Quetta out of the bath-chair.”</p>

<p>Harriet flew, nearly annihilating the examiner.
Wiggie met Lanty’s eyes with the smile that he had
already seen on another pair of lips.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing dangerous! Come out and talk, will
you, when business is over? Isn’t this jolly? I don’t
care <i>what</i> Harriet says. I should like to eat <i>all</i> that
butter myself!”</p>

<p>He moved away, followed by looks of passionate
gratitude from the disheartened competitors, and
Lanty mounted the platform.</p>

<p>“Seen Dandy Anne?” Hamer asked him in a loud
whisper, when he had shaken hands all round, and
found a chair. Grumphy crawled from under the
table, and snored against his knee. Hamer laughed
with suppressed jollity.</p>

<p>“She’s making butter!” he announced in a joyful
undertone. “Insisted on having a shot at seeing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
what she could make out. Taken all the ten lessons,
as serious as seven Sundays all in a lump! Our
Dandy Anne! Funny, isn’t it?—though you needn’t
say I said so. I hope she’ll pull through all right.
Mother here’ll be sadly vexed if she comes out with a
duck-egg!”</p>

<p>He pointed surreptitiously, and, looking along the
lines of farmers’ daughters, running his eye from faces
he knew personally to others whose parentage was
easily placed, Lanty found Dandy at last no more
than two churns away.</p>

<p>She looked extraordinarily serious, as Hamer had
said, and not only serious but anxious; not only
anxious but even—just a little—dishevelled. Her
butter had been a long time in coming, and though
she had it on the worker by now, it would be a race
to finish it. She had seen Lanty when his head first
topped the hill, and after that she had done everything
wrong, forgotten her plug, made a thorough
hash of lifting out the butter and had then over-salted
it, so that the marks against her were
totting up like a washing-bill, to the distress of
the examiner, who admired her exceedingly. That
poor four pounds was worked and overworked until
it didn’t know itself, and was received for weighing
with grunted contempt. With flushed cheeks and
escaping hair, Dandy took it back to finish, and tried
to console herself with a perfectly-executed pattern.
Lanty watched her with interest, and decided that he
liked her—just a little—dishevelled.</p>

<p>And then at last came a stir of relief from the patient
audience, and the white figures retreated to a form,
looking excited and hot. The examiner prefaced his
report with a short lecture upon butter in general,
keeping a nervous eye on Harriet the while. She was
on the point of argument more than once, but Wiggie,
close at hand, always seemed to know when the
explosion was due, and conjured up a Quetta-ling to
distract her.</p>

<p>The examiner was very pleased to be there that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
day, and very pleased with results, and everything that
had gone wrong had, of course, been pure accident
or a passing spasm of forgetfulness or sheer evil fate.
Because everybody had meant excellently, and that,
of course, was the main thing, as where there was a
will there was a way, and the person who made a
mistake to-day would most certainly correct it to-morrow,
etc., etc. Still, mistakes that day were in
such negligible quantity that they were really not
worth mentioning. Indeed, he was happy to say
that he had been able to place the whole of the competitors
in the first-class, with one exception only.
Here he looked with such agonised care at least six
feet over Dandy’s head that everybody else instantly
looked six feet lower. This, of course, did not imply
that the aforesaid competitor was hopelessly behind
the rest; it only meant that her work was not quite
up to the standard. Indeed, any one who had watched
this particular competitor could see with half an eye
that she knew perfectly well how to make butter, only
she had been unfortunate. Everybody knew that
butter could turn nasty if it liked, and it had treated
her badly. She had had other misfortunes, too—little
troubles connected with the plug, etc.—but it was
really hardly worth while to dwell upon them. He
was most decidedly pleased to be there! And this
time he looked six feet down and straight at Dandy,
so adoringly that all the audience who had really nice
feelings instantly looked six feet up.</p>

<p>Then one of the pretty county ladies rose and said
how pleased <i>she</i> was to be there, and how pleased
everybody else was pleased, and how more than
pleased everybody would be when they read about it
in the papers, while the competitors wished she
would hurry up and put them out of their misery,
and thought how infinitely more desirable it was to
stand on a platform and look charming and sweet and
say all the right things in exactly the right way, with
an adoring husband somewhere behind, than to make
the best butter in the Three Kingdoms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>After that, the certificates were given out, and the
noble first-class came up blushing and bowing to
receive the spoils of war. Finally, Dandy, for her
duck-egg.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that the tent was ten miles long and
packed like a Military Tournament. She saw the
examiner’s eyes bulging with pity, and wondered
absently why they didn’t fall out. She heard her
father’s big whisper: “Now then, Mother, don’t you
fret! Don’t fret, Mother!” and knew that he was
patting his wife’s hand. She heard the caretaker’s
grunt. And at the foot of the steps she felt exactly
as if hot needles were dancing red-slippered all over
her, simply because there was one very ordinary person
sitting on the platform, engaged in staring at his
boots.</p>

<p>But as she curtsied to the pretty lady and the duck-egg,
wishing herself at Halsted for the last time in her
life, Harriet came suddenly to her rescue.</p>

<p>“Good lad, Dandy!” she bawled, clapping like a
small thunderstorm, and the general embarrassment
broke in a burst of amusement and applause. Everybody
laughed; competitors, audience, the miserable
examiner—thrilling with gratitude towards his late
tormentor—and Dandy herself. Grumphy waddled
forward to the extreme edge, and reached out a long,
loving tongue.</p>

<p>“I am sure we all appreciate Miss Shaw’s sporting
effort!” the pretty lady said prettily, and there was
more applause. Dandy looked up bravely and met
Lanty’s eyes, turned on her at last as if they really
saw her.</p>

<p>“It was very bad butter!” she said candidly, putting
out a hand to the rolling tongue, and raising a fresh
laugh by her cheerful honesty. Lancaster leaned
forward, smiling.</p>

<p>“May I buy it for that thin dog of mine?” he
asked; and instantly the Lane was about them both
instead of the crowded tent, and a vision of rippling
wind on the turning corn. They had been alien, then;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
he had almost frankly disliked her; but that was long
ago, and in this moment they were all the nearer for it.
She had said that she was looking for herself, even as
Grumphy, galumphing through new wheat; and in
looking for herself she had found somebody—ah, how
much dearer! And <i>he</i> had said that the whip was the
only teacher. Well, she had come through many a
scourging of longing and revolt, unbearable pain, self-hatred
and contempt, and had learned many things;
but in this hour of absurd humiliation she knew that
the one great thing she had learned she had at last
taught him also. She turned and went blindly
through the still cheering crowd to her seat. But it
was twenty miles back, because she went from him.</p>

<p>As they streamed out of the tent, Bluecaster came
over a hedge on a splashed hunter, and the Quetta-lings,
who had a passion for all locomotion that did
not include plain walking upon their own legs, swarmed
up him. Harriet stalked after them, and lifted the
Little Great Quetta down again, because he was
precious. The big, black eyes filled with tears, but he
did not rebel. He knew that he was precious, and
it had very serious drawbacks.</p>

<p>Lanty ran into Denny, standing in tongue-tied
admiration before a Miss Braithwaite. So had he
stood all afternoon, from the first whirl of the
swinging churn to the proud moment when she had
laid before the examiner the four best pounds of the
day. He started when Lanty tapped him on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Your wife will have plenty of sale for her butter,
Thomas!” he told him slyly.</p>

<p>Denny reddened hotly, and found his tongue with a
rush.</p>

<p>“Ay! an’ yours’ll likely be her first customer!”
he retorted briskly, with meaning, and chuckled as he
saw his embarrassment reflected. He had caught the
episode of the duck-egg. Lanty went away hurriedly.</p>

<p>Wiggie joined him on the slope, with Edgar and his
Southern wife, and they went down together to Watters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
to find Dandy and the examiner putting the last
touches to the waiting meal, while Helwise rooked the
instructress for a bazaar. Harriet and Stubbs followed
with the rolling ruffians, and then Bluecaster. Bluecaster
had taken the Little Great Quetta to see the
horse stabled, because you may sometimes look on at
interesting things, even if you <i>are</i> precious. And lastly,
Mr. and Mrs. Shaw with their other butter-supporting
guests, who were still as pleased about everything as
ever. They did not stay long, though, having some
distance to drive; and then the Quetta-lings were
able to let themselves go with Italian shrieks and wild,
operatic gestures. Only the Little Great Quetta sat
silent and could not eat for quivering excitement,
because a real, live, large horse had munched out of
his thin, little hand; until Bluecaster, with a furtive
air of removing his neighbour’s landmark, took him on
his knee and fed him himself.</p>

<p>Lanty looked round the big, joyous, crowded room,
and in spite of the buzz of talk and the soaring, staccato
shrieks, felt again the peace that had met him, months
ago, on his first entrance. He was happy, too. It
came to him with a shock, since he had been so sure
that he could never be happy again. Hamer made him
happy, moving about gloriously contented with the
swarm under his roof; and Mrs. Shaw, presiding with
conjuring cleverness over her teapot. Dandy had
given hers to Helwise, who loved the effect of her white
fingers on the silver handle, and took care to do nothing
more active than incline the spout gently towards each
cup. Dandy did not make him feel happy, though.
She made him feel breathless, and as if he would like
to climb on the table and shriek with the Quetta-lings.
It was safer not to look at her.</p>

<p>Wiggie, however, murmuring at his side, busily
bridging a big gap with his summer experiences, filled
him, as usual, with little chuckles of content. Lanty
noticed that he never forgot to turn his face so that
his brother might read his words. Presently he went
a step further back still.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>“Did I ever tell you that all the players in that
hockey-match turned up again, one after another, to
say how sorry they were I was ill? I thought it so
awfully decent of them! It helped a lot, I can tell
you. Saunders <i>did</i> say that, if only I had stayed in
my place, he could have done all the work and perhaps
saved me something, but that’s—well—just Saunders,
isn’t it?—and he brought me a book on the actinic
force of light, to cheer me up a bit when I was getting
better. Do <i>you</i> know anything about the actinic force
of light? Neither did I till I met Saunders, but I do
now. I learned it up to talk to him. The little curate
said that he had saved my life, and that I owed him
a penny bun. Harriet was very angry—you’ve no
idea! She said there was plenty of food in the kitchen,
and that he had done nothing but sit still while a motor-car
took him somewhere, and that anybody, even an
idiot or a parson, could have done <i>that</i>. The curate
said the point was that he was the body on the spot.
It was his motto. In the family, he said, like dear
old Stubbs. I like him. He lent me a novel by—perhaps
I had better not say it out loud. The others
were all awfully kind, too. I liked them. I remarked
to Harriet one day that they seemed to be really
keen on music up here, and she just snorted. She
said: ‘You don’t imagine, do you, that they care a
straw about your being a singer, any more than I do?
They’re simply stuck on you because you stole that
goal!’ Edgar wasn’t a bit pleased—were you, old
man?—and Gardner said awful things, but I think I
liked it.”</p>

<p>“He is the Great Quetta!” Edgar put in, with a
note of indignation in his deep, curious voice.</p>

<p>Wiggie laughed.</p>

<p>“Do you know that they say I may—perhaps—be
able to sing again, in a year’s time? I’ve still a half-crown
or two in the toe of a stocking, and Edgar’s got
a post somewhere where they waggle their fingers
instead of their tongues, so the babies won’t starve
yet awhile. We’ll keep the pot boiling, somehow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
but I do not think I shall ever be the Great Quetta
again.”</p>

<p>Edgar uttered an exclamation of angry pain, and
his brother smiled at him affectionately. Blenkinship’s
Marget came up and handed him a medicine-glass,
and he finished the tail of the smile on her.</p>

<p>“What does it matter? Anyhow, I can always
teach; and the Little Great Quetta will keep us all
out of the Workhouse when we’re old! You must
hear him sing, Lancaster. He has the true singer’s
throat, and cords like the harp of all the winds. Perfect
ear, of course. Even the Quetta-lings, shrieking
themselves hoarse over there, have <i>that</i>. He will be
the Greatest Quetta some day, please God, and make
up to Edgar for his poor old ears, and to me for all the
poor other things that have gone wrong in my inside—won’t
he, old man?”</p>

<p>“He looks very sensitive,” Lanty observed, watching
the child.</p>

<p>“The instrument has to be tuned,” Wiggie answered,
rather sadly. “It is out of wrung strings that both
God and man make their sweetest music.”</p>

<p>“Still jabbering about your stupid singing!”
Harriet scoffed, thrusting a plate of scones into his
face. “Try these. They’re buttered with Wild Duck.
I told the examiner it was the stuff from the Van, and
he cleared out like a shot, and hasn’t been seen since.
By the way, the L.G. knows what you call your
Quetta-Song perfectly now. He was singing it all
morning.”</p>

<p>“It’s a song I used to sing,” Wiggie explained, for
Lanty’s benefit, “a song about lambkins and resting-places
and things. We call it the Quetta-Song because
the Quettas never have a resting-place. They are
always on the move.”</p>

<p>“I know a song like that,” Lanty said slowly, out
of far depths when Harriet had turned away, and
nobody but Wiggie could hear. “<i>I</i> call it my Home-Song.
I heard it years ago at the Westmorland
Festival.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>“You heard <i>me</i>,” Wiggie said simply. “I remember
singing it there. It is known as the Quetta-Song in
the profession, so the others do not sing it. It was
when I first came out and was plump and pretty, with
my voice not quite full grown, so of course you wouldn’t
remember me. But I thank you ever so much for
remembering the song.”</p>

<p>“I always remembered it, but I lost faith in it,”
Lanty said. “I could find no home to match the
song.”</p>

<p>“But you will find it soon!” Wiggie answered with
a quick look, and saw where the other’s eyes turned.
“I have found mine,” he added. He stood up as
Harriet came back. “Harriet—when may I come
home again?”</p>

<p>“Home?” Harriet stared.</p>

<p>“Home to Wild Duck—for good!”</p>

<p>They gazed at each other over the plate of scones,
and then, still clasping it, the Rur’l D’trict C’cillor
fled from the room. The Great Quetta (who was only
Wiggie) followed.</p>

<p>“Seen Brack lately?” Hamer inquired in a low
tone, dropping into the vacant chair. Lanty nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve come across him a good deal. He often
looks in to see me, too. But he’s leaving—did you
know?—giving up Thweng in the spring, and going
out to Canada again, to join Lup. They say he wants
to take Braithwaite’s youngest girl with him. He’s
money, you know, so he can afford to play about
between the Continents. I’ll be sorry to lose him—yes,
it’s come to that, though I’d never have believed
it! There’s nothing he won’t do for me, nowadays.
Oh, he’s the old Brack again, of course!—all the stage-effects
piled on as thick as ever—but the old Brack
with a difference. He still goes to church, by the
way.”</p>

<p>“New life for everybody,” Hamer mused. “There’s
not much doubt where Cyril will end, is there? You’ll
be putting out your hand, too, my boy!”</p>

<p>Lanty looked at him with a question in his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>“Put it out soon!” said Hamer.</p>

<p>Bluecaster left, shortly afterwards, and the agent
walked part of the way with him.</p>

<p>“You’ll come back?” Hamer begged, concerned.
“You’ll stop to dinner, you and your aunt? I’ve
scarcely had the tail of a word with you, with all those
folks to see to. Come back!”</p>

<p>And all the rest of the party gathered on the steps
and called after him as he went down the drive—kindly
Shaws and gentle Quettas, Helwise, smilingly satisfied
and perfectly at home, and Stubbs, untroubled by the
least alluring vision of any White Lion, all under the
long, creepered house in the opal evening. “Come
back! Be sure you come back!”</p>

<p>The two men turned into the Lane, walking by the
tired horse, and after their short business chat was
finished they went on some way together in silence.
Bluecaster was going abroad again soon to his usual
winter round, but to-night he went back alone to his
big, lonely house. Lanty was glad that, behind himself,
the friendly, happy party awaited him at Watters.</p>

<p>Bluecaster’s would always be a lonely life, he thought,
unconsciously prophetic. Such a temperament as his
would send him weaponless into every battle, and
receive him back more sure than ever of the forces
arrayed against him, yet pathetically ready to the
bitter end. And each defeat would leave him more
silent and more shy. Yes—and more lovable, he said
to himself, holding his stirrup for him while he mounted,
and watching for the last courteous salute that he knew
would be sent him from the turn. Bluecaster might
be little more than a symbol of great ideals beyond his
perfect grasp, but even as such he met a passionate
need in the stronger man behind him, since every
brave Viking-soul sails forth the happier for the
figurehead and the spilt wine.</p>

<p>There was coming into the sky the steely clearness
of still autumn, and a faint breath of frost was promised
by the yellow bar yet lingering on the horizon and the
starkening edge of the woods. It was darker and stiller<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
in the Lane, and when Dandy grew out of the mist
creeping up from the earth beneath, she came with the
hush and mystery of vapour-borne elves. Not only
was she not outside any more, but she had looked right
into the fairies’ haunts and bent her ear to their
rippling talk. Across the almost fiercely-pure sky the
birds went home.</p>

<p>Close at hand, she had still her mystery, but now it
was human and breathing, with kind, shy eyes and
delicate colour coming to and fro.</p>

<p>“Wiggie sent me!” she said rather breathlessly.
“He told me to stop you at the last gap as you came
back. He said you had lost something, and would
find it there, if you looked. Do you know what he
meant? He wouldn’t explain—just packed me off
with the message. I don’t know what to make of
him—he’s like a schoolboy to-night! It’s glorious
to see him getting well, isn’t it? You wouldn’t believe
how pleased Watters was to have him back! Two
roses bloomed in the night under his window, and at
dawn there were half-a-dozen birds waiting on the
sill.”</p>

<p>“I believe he’s a wizard!” Lanty smiled. “Look
at Harriet! He has her at the end of a string.”</p>

<p>“Harriet has fallen in love with him! I believe it
happened the night he came to Crabtree—the dreadful
night after the storm when I brought you the soup—I
mean, when Our Agnes—Wiggie—Harriet——” She
floundered, agonised and helpless.</p>

<p>He stopped, looking at her with a frown.</p>

<p>“When <i>you</i> brought me the soup?”</p>

<p>“Yes. No!” She was almost in tears at the
unmeant revelation. “It was Harriet! <i>She</i> made it,
and there were cockroaches—a tin of something—I
washed the pan.”</p>

<p>He held doggedly to his question.</p>

<p>“When <i>you</i> brought me the soup?”</p>

<p>“I carried it in—that was all—and you didn’t know.
You thought it was the servant! But I only found the
tray-cloth. It was Harriet——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>“Bother Harriet!” he said cruelly, and put his
hands on her shoulders, trying to see her face. “It
was <i>you</i> who fed me, <i>you</i> who lighted the fire and tidied
up those horrible papers, and were good to me all
round? And I didn’t know!”</p>

<p>“No, you didn’t know!” She let her pride slip
through soft fingers and looked up at him, all the pain
of that gone hour in her sobbing voice. “But you
ought to have known—oh, you ought, you <i>ought</i>! I
wanted to be good to you more than anything in the
world, and you wouldn’t let me. I asked you—I
begged in my heart—how was it you did not hear? I
did not dare to speak aloud. You had said I did not
understand—do you remember?—and I was afraid.
So when I found you did not hear, I went away, and
you let me go. You let me go!”</p>

<p>“I was out on a far road, sweetheart, and I had lost
you in the dark. I doubt I haven’t got back to you,
even yet!”</p>

<p>“Come soon!” she whispered, in his arms.</p>

<p>Behind them, a crystal voice broke into singing,
and, turning, they looked together through the last
Green Gate of Vision. On the hill-side a little child
was standing with his face turned to the bar of sunset,
as if he sang to listening souls behind that dying door
of gold. Far out of sight, the Quettas stood arm in
arm, risking their Little Great Quetta in the autumn
mist. There was nothing framed by the Gate of Vision
but the sleeping land and the singing child.</p>

<p>He sang the Wander-Song of the Quettas, that was
Lancaster’s Song of Home.</p>

<p>With the last note he stayed, looking up at the
door of Heaven closing before him. Almost he might
have seen the long years of wandering and struggle,
searing glory and usuried fame, before he came to his
last, soft sleeping-place on the Arm of God.</p>

<p>“And <i>my</i> place?” Lanty whispered. “It is cold

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the marsh there was the breath of mown hay
that comes when the grass is ready, before ever the
scythe is swung or the cutter yoked. On the eve of
his wedding, Lancaster walked the ribbon of road
alone.</p>

<p>To-morrow Helwise would be gone, joyfully transplanted
to Watters for life, and in her place his dear
love, with all his joy in her hands. He closed a reverent
palm on the leaping thought, and turned to send his
tribute out across the sea.</p>

<p>The Let had come through the winter months unharmed,
but the unbuttressed Lugg looked pitifully
rent, with its six doors set open for any flood to charge
unchallenged. Year after year it would shrink and
crumble, beaten and torn, until the memory of its
fame would be but a tale mumbled in old men’s
mouths. And not a hand had been laid on the Pride
since the Whinnerahs had gone out with the dawn.
Tide after tide swam cold into its wrecked rooms, and
took its flotsam of broken sticks. In the little fire-lit
home the waves swallowed the empty hearth and
fretted the mouldering walls. Where the kettle had
sung and the tired dogs breathed in a happy sleep, the
bitter water plashed and moaned.</p>

<p>Yet the sea had not won. Wolf was its victor,
though it had dragged him down and strangled him
out of life. For many waters cannot quench love,
neither can the floods drown it.</p>

<p>On this the eve of blessed beginnings, Lancaster
gave himself wholly to his faithful dead.</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

</div>

of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
